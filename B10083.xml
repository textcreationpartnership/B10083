            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>IT hath been a uſual, ſubtile and wicked Policy of the Devil and Evil Men, first to render <hi>Names</hi> Odious; and then by affixing them to <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> thereby to render them ſo too, with the vulgar; whom, by that means, they impoſe upon, and make their Tools. By ſuch means have not only the <hi>Chriſtians of Old,</hi> but alſo ſome of the chief <hi>Principles of Chriſtianity</hi> been much injured and abuſed: And few <hi>Parties</hi> there are, who have not one time or other ſmarted by it. That the <hi>well-meaning Reader</hi> therefore may not be ſo abuſed and impoſed upon in his Judgment of the things here put together for the Benefit of all, who can receive them, by the Odious Names of <hi>Monkery</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> it is to be obſerved, that though <hi>POPERY,</hi> taken properly for the Abuſes and Corruptions of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> may deſerve all the Odium caſt upon it, yet may most vile and wicked Abuſes be committed by Pretence and Imputation of that Odious Name: And in ſome things it is hard to ſay, Whether the People have been more abuſed by <hi>Popery</hi> it ſelf, or by the <hi>Odium</hi> and <hi>Imputation</hi> of the <hi>Name?</hi> And not only the People, but the Goſpel it ſelf: I may add,
<pb facs="tcp:192035:5"/>and the <hi>Reformation</hi> too. For, while Chriſtian Truths have been miſ-repreſented, and expoſed to Contempt and Odium under the Name of <hi>Popery,</hi> the <hi>Cauſe</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Popery</hi> is ſupported, ſtrengthened, and made ſo much the more defenſible by the intermixture of ſo much Truth; and the <hi>Cauſe</hi> on the ſide of the <hi>Reformation</hi> ſo much the more weakened and diſparaged by the intermixture of ſo much indefenſible Error. Whereas, if they were only things inexcuſable in them which were queſtioned, as Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doth require, they must have ſunk in the Cauſe long before this; but an indiſcreet Affectation of Reformation and uncharitable ſeeking Occaſions, have made a <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> now as needful on the one ſide, as the other. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this might be ſhewed in divers particulars; but I need not ſtep out of my way for that, the other Name mentioned may ſerve for that purpoſe here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>MONKERY</hi> is not only rendered Odious, as of it ſelf, but alſo as a part of <hi>Popery.</hi> And, indeed, if we imagin all that is believed or practiſed by the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to be <hi>Popery,</hi> it may be ſo: but then we ſhall leave little of true Chriſtianity for the <hi>Reformation:</hi> But if what is <hi>true Chriſtianity</hi> be not <hi>Popery,</hi> than neither is <hi>Monkery,</hi> as ſome are pleaſed to call the <hi>Monaſtick Life;</hi> And that it is not only true Chriſtianity, but the Practice of it in the greatest Perfection that Mortals are capable of, I am apt to think will be very plain to any who will conſider what here follows with an unprejudiced and competent Judgment. And therefore I ſhall not need to ſay more here, but only deſire the Reader to ſuſpend his Judgment till he hath peruſed and conſidered it well.</p>

                  <head>THE Beginning and Progreſs OF Contemplative Living, AND Religious Societies.</head>
                  <p>THAT there are in the very Nature of Man ſome <hi>Principles of Inclination to Religion,</hi> which, if not corrupted by <hi>Evil Education,</hi> or other unhappy Occurrences, do inſenſibly grow and increaſe in Strength and Vigour, and in due time exert themſelves in Action; though for ſome time they lie dormant as it were, and do not appear; even as ſome others, which in all Animals are manifeſtly moſt Natural, and yet appear not till after ſome growth toward Maturity; hath been obſerved, believed, and aſſerted, by Men of greateſt Reputation for Learning and Wiſdom, both in Ancient times, and to this Day.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:192035:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p> Theſe Principles have among Man-kind been, in many much <hi>corrupted and ſtifled</hi> by Evil Education, or Converſation with Evil Perſons, and by the Impreſſions, Energy, and Inſtigations of Evil Spirits; but in others again much <hi>che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and improved,</hi> not only by Good Education and Converſation, and by Conſideration of the Works of Nature; but moreover, and eſpecially, by the kind Influences of the Divine Majeſty, and of his Good Miniſtring Spirits.</p>
                  <p>From hence, in all Ages, and in all Parts of the World, have been produced and raiſed up Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and Wiſe, and Holy Men and Women, who have been as Lights and Examples to the reſt, of ſeveral ſorts, according to their <hi>different Ways of Living;</hi> ſome living a Life of <hi>Civil Converſation</hi> with others, but ſtrictly conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, <hi>walking in all the Commandments and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Lord, blameleſs,</hi> as is ſaid of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, Luk.</hi> 6. or, to ſpeak more comprehenſively, <hi>living in all Good Conſcience before God,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.1. or according to the Character of <hi>Job, Perfect, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright, fearing God, and eſchewing Evil,</hi> Job 1.1. Others living a more abſtracted Life of <hi>Retirement</hi> and <hi>Contemplation;</hi> abſtracted not only from Buſineſs in the World, but alſo from ordinary Converſation with Men, that they might without Diſtraction converſe with God, and his bleſſed Miniſtring Spirits: and others
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192035:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>again living a kind of mixt or middle Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, avoiding unneceſſary Buſineſs and Incumberances, and exerciſing <hi>Recollections</hi> and <hi>Abſtraction,</hi> as much as their Occaſions would permit, and even in, and amidſt their Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Of thoſe Three Ways of Living, that more ſtrict and <hi>Contemplative Life</hi> is believed, by divers Learned Men, to have been begun by <hi>ENOS,</hi> or in his time; and not without reaſon: For, as the Principles before-mentioned were apt to produce ſuch an Effect, ſo there ſeems to be ſomething ſingular noted concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> or ſome <hi>Religious Inſtitution</hi> or <hi>Practice</hi> in that Sacred Record, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But of the more ancient Times, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood, but alſo for ſome Ages after the Flood, we know but very little: But in the Times of which, we have ſome more Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, beſides PRIESTS, and profeſſed PHILOSOPHERS, there have always been both <hi>ſingle Perſons,</hi> and <hi>compleat</hi> or <hi>formed Societies of People,</hi> who, diſcerning the Vanity and Emptineſs of Earthly things, and Solidity and Perminence of Heavenly things, withdrew themſelves from thoſe of the Earth, as much as their Mortal State could bear, and applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves intirely to the Contemplation and Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of thoſe of a more excellent Nature, living an <hi>Abſtracted</hi> and <hi>Angelick Life</hi> in Mortal Fleſh,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:192035:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>in Holy Converſation, and Favour with God and his bleſſed Miniſtring Spirits. And ſome did actually and expreſsly conſecrate themſelves by <hi>Vow</hi> unto the ſpecial Service of God.</p>
                  <p>Of which Sort were thoſe among the <hi>Jews,</hi> called NAZARITES, becauſe they did ſo ſeparate themſelves from among Men, to attend upon God. The Sacred Hiſtory, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. is a Record, not of the Original, but of the Divine Approbation of <hi>Nazarites,</hi> which, though that be very ancient, yet were much more ancient, and more ancient than any Man can tell: And God's Ordering of the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of their Conſecration and Obſervations for that People, is a manifeſt Indication of his Divine Approbation of the thing it ſelf, which had been in uſe long before.</p>
                  <p>All do agree that they were <hi>of Two ſorts;</hi> ſome, only for certain time; others, perpetual for their whole Life; and thoſe may again be diſtinguiſhed into Three ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as were call'd or appointed by God, as <hi>Samſon,</hi> a <hi>Nazarite unto God from the Womb,</hi> Judg. 13.5, 7: 16.17. and as St. <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated effectually, and <hi>filled with the Holy Spirit even from his Mother's Womb,</hi> Luk. 1.15. Such as were dedicated by their Parents, as <hi>Samuel</hi> by his Mother, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.10, 28. And ſuch as did freely offer themſelves: And this <hi>Free-will Offering of themſelves,</hi> though but for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:192035:7"/>a certain time, God did accept no leſs than the Free-will Offerings of their Goods, or any thing they had, <hi>v. Lev.</hi> 22.18, 21, 23: 27.2. and therefore ordered the Rites and Circumſtances of their Conſecration and Obſervations, as was ſaid before. And, on the contrary, the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of <hi>Nazarites</hi> is reckoned as a part of the Puniſhment of the People, by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.7. But it is reckoned by God among his Divine Favours to that People, that he raiſed up <hi>Nazarites</hi> amongſt them; and reckoned with his bringing them up from the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and raiſing them Prophets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. <hi>Amos</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>I raiſed up of your Sons for Prophets, and of your Young Men for Nazarites.</hi> Though they might freely offer themſelves, yet it was God that did ſecretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire and incline their Wills. And therefore theſe were <hi>Holy,</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> hath well obſerved, <hi>Hom.</hi> 11. <hi>in Levit. If any one devotes himſelf to God, if any one intangles himſelf in no ſecular Buſineſs, that he may pleaſe Him, to whom he hath approved himſelf; if any one is ſeparate from the reſt of Men, who live Worldly Lives, and are obliged in ſecular Buſineſs, not ſeeking the things which are upon Earth, but which are in Heaven, he is deſervedly called HOLY, or SAINT.</hi> And after much to this purpoſe, he concludes in theſe Words: <hi>From all which it is clear, how every one of us, who will be Holy, ought to be conſecrated to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:192035:8"/>God, and thenceforth be imployed in no Buſineſs or Acts which relate not to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So likewiſe the <hi>Colledges or Schools of the</hi> PROPHETS, though we meet with no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs mention of them till in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.5. yet certain it is, that they were much more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, who, under the Name of <hi>Prophets,</hi> lived very abſtracted Lives. The very change of the Denomination, mentioned in the chap. next fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.9. is an Evidence of that, <hi>viz.</hi> That he, who was then call'd a <hi>Prophet,</hi> was afore-time call'd a SEER; and therefore when one went <hi>to inquire of the Lord,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>Come, and let us go to the Seer.</hi> And if <hi>to inquire of the Lord,</hi> was <hi>to go to the Seer,</hi> than that leads us back to the time of <hi>Rebecca, Gen.</hi> 25.22. for <hi>Seers;</hi> and how much farther back no Man knows: for that certainly was no new thing then. Nor doth it appear that the <hi>Schools of the Prophets</hi> were firſt inſtituted by <hi>Samuel:</hi> But that they lived ſuch <hi>abſtracted Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Lives,</hi> is undeniable, both from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Profeſſion, and from the Particulars of the Matter of Fact of their Converſation men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Nor were there <hi>Men</hi> only, but WOMEN alſo, who did very anciently, leaving the World, apply themſelves to Matters of Devotion, though perhaps not with ſo ſolemn Conſecration; ſuch as <hi>Anna,</hi> a Propheteſs, who having lived ſeven
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:192035:8"/>years a Wife, lived afterwards a Widow till eighty four years of Age, and departed not from the Temple, but ſerved God with Faſtings and Prayers Night and Day. For of this ſort of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Women</hi> were there many among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as anciently as the Tabernacle in the Wilderneſs, as we are informed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the moſt learned Criticks of this Age; as <hi>Munſter, Fagius, Vatablus,</hi> and others, upon <hi>Exodus</hi> 38.8. And this, it is very probable, was a great Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sins of the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.22. that the Women, whom they abuſed, were ſuch as theſe, <hi>who aſſembled at the Door of the Tabar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> as learned Criticks inform us. And put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all theſe Notices together, it ſeems that ſuch Religious Devout Women there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> at leaſt from the time of their firſt abode in the Wilderneſs, while they had the Temple ſtanding amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>And if ſo, Why not long before, even while in <hi>Egypt?</hi> Had they not received Religious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from their Anceſtours? or, Did they retain none of them? or, Did they ſee nothing of Religion practiſed among the <hi>Egyptians?</hi> and, Had they not the ſame Natural Propenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Religion, which is common to all Men? We ſee how ready and expert all the Women were at the Red-Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1, 20. with <hi>Miriam,</hi> a Propheteſs, to anſwer <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Men; and, Can we imagin that all Religion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:192035:9"/>had been extinguiſhed, or lain dormant in their Abode in <hi>Egypt?</hi> No certainly; their hard Servitude, though it might hinder their more Solemn Worſhip, yet it could not hinder, but did rather excite and provoke to more retired and ſecret Devotion. And indeed, that Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with Rigour and hard Bondage, was not till a little before their Deliverance; and even then do we find that generous Magnanimity, even among the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Women, the <hi>Midwives,</hi> as to obey God rather than Man, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.17.</p>
                  <p>The Companies of the PROPHETS, mentioned 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.10. and 19.20. ſuch as elſe-where are call'd <hi>the Sons of the Prophets,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.4: 20.35. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.3, 5, 7, 15: 4.38: 6.1, 2: 9.1. were a ſort of Religious Perſons, who lived Abſtracted Contemplative Lives; many of them plainly <hi>Coenobitical Lives,</hi> and ſome <hi>Anachoretical</hi> or <hi>Hermete Lives,</hi> as St. <hi>Antony,</hi> and others among the Chriſtians did, as <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.1. and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.6. So that St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaid very truly, <hi>Every Order or Inſtitution of Life hath its Principals</hi> or <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> and then after divers Inſtances in others, he adds; <hi>Our Leaders are ſuch as</hi> Paul, <hi>as</hi> Antony, <hi>as</hi> Julian, <hi>as</hi> Hilarian, <hi>as the</hi> Macerius<hi>'s: And to return to the Authority of the Scriptures, our Prince or Leader was</hi> Elias, <hi>was</hi> Eliſha; <hi>our Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were the Sons of the Prophets, who dwelt in Fields, and Deſerts, or Solitary Places, and made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:192035:9"/>themſelves Tabernacles or Cells by the River of</hi> Jordan: <hi>Of this Company were alſo the Sons of</hi> Racab, <hi>&amp;c. Ep.</hi> 13. <hi>ad Paulin.</hi> p. 34. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>The Sons of the Prophets, whom we read to have been Monks in the Old Teſtament, did build themſelves Cottages or Cells near the River of</hi> Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, <hi>and leaving the Crowds of the Cities, lived on Barley-Cakes and Field-Herbs,</hi> Ep. 4. ad Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticum. <hi>pa.</hi> 11. And if ſome of them lived in Cities, that doth no more invalidate what St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, than <hi>Monaſteries</hi> being brought into Cities by St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> is an Argument againſt their being Monks, who have dwelt in ſuch ever ſince. Such Cavils do only prove the Partiality and Diſingenuity of the Authours, and ſignifie no more to any Perſon of Judgment and Candour; ſince they cannot deny, but are forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, <hi>That the Prophets,</hi> Samuel, Elias, <hi>and</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha, <hi>did inſtitute Colledges, in which many Diſciples did live together.</hi> So then they lived a <hi>Coeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitick Life:</hi> and, What was their Food and Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Was it coſtly and delicious, or poor and mean? and, What was <hi>their Imployment?</hi> Can we imagin it to have been other, than Studying the Scriptures, after <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, and the large Book of Nature, the Works of God, of Creation, of Providence, Prayers, Pſalms, and Divine Contemplation, and Works and Labours about what was neceſſary for them, and no more? And if we conſider the admirable Graces
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:192035:10"/>of the <hi>Ancient Chriſtian Monks,</hi> it will be an hard matter for an honeſt Man to find any difference between the <hi>Chriſtian Monks</hi> and the <hi>Jewiſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> more than in Name. And for the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of theſe, Is it any Argument that there were none before, if we do not read of any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? How and by whom did they <hi>inquire of the Lord?</hi> Was <hi>Iſrael</hi> only without Prophets? Was <hi>Balaam</hi> the firſt in his Nation, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? or, Were there Prophets, who did not ordinarily live Prophetick Lives? or, if they did, What was the Difference? But ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Spirits as have too long contemned and inſulted upon the moſt Heroick Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, and abuſed the People with their Sophiſtry, muſt anſwer for their Preſumption, Raſhneſs, Temporizing, and incouraging of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge before God, though the Degeneracy of the Modern Monks had provoked his Judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and among Men their Names will be little regarded hereafter. But all are not alike, and therefore I will here add a Note of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>'s, concerning this Matter, upon 2 <hi>King. We will moreover obſerve,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Diſciples of the Prophets did live together with their Preceptors; For ſo they ſay;</hi> The Place where we dwell with thee, is too ſtrait for us. <hi>It ſeems to have been a kind of Monaſtick Life, but free without Vows or Superſtitions.</hi> (But <hi>Vows</hi> we find approved by God in the <hi>Nazarites,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:192035:10"/>and practiſed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and others; and that they were not in uſe among theſe, is more than any one can prove: but he goes on:) <hi>They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed themſelves in Divine Scriptures and Hymns; and alſo in Holy Prayers: They were often ſent to edifie the People, and to confirm Holy Men, who lived amongſt Idolaters in ſound and true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They ſeem moreover to have exerciſed ſome Arts, working with their Hands to get a Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo much for this.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time with <hi>Eliſha</hi> lived <hi>Jonadab</hi> the Son of <hi>Rechab,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.15. who inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted another Order of Religious Perſons, called after his Father's Name, RECHABITES. Theſe were not of any of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but <hi>Kenites</hi> deſcended of <hi>Jethro, Moſes</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law. <hi>v.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.55. <hi>Jud.</hi> 1.16. who was Prieſt of <hi>Midian, Exod.</hi> 2.16: 3.1: 18.1. and one who worſhipped the true God: for he bleſſed God, when he heard the Relation of what he had done for the <hi>Iſraelites, Exod.</hi> 18.10. and in the uſual Form in ſuch Caſes, juſt as <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> did long before, upon the Victory of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 14.20. but they are reckoned among them of the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.55. becauſe they came up with them out of the Wilderneſs, <hi>Jud.</hi> 1.16. and for that reaſon, and becauſe they dwelt in Tents, are thought to be call'd <hi>the Tents of Juda,</hi> Zech.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:192035:11"/>12.7. But they are call'd, the <hi>Families of the Scribes,</hi> 1 Chron. 2.55. And therefore both from their Deſcent, and from their Quality of <hi>Scribes,</hi> and from their Inſtitution, and from the very Form of God's Promiſe to them, we may reaſonably conclude them to have been <hi>a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Order.</hi> And indeed, that alone is ſufficient to demonſtrate it was ſome ſpecial Service to God, they were imploy'd in: for it is expreſſed in the ſame terms, which are uſed concerning the <hi>Tribe of Levi,</hi> when the Lord ſeparated them to his ſpecial Service, <hi>viz. to ſtand before the Lord,</hi> Deut. 10.8. <hi>v.</hi> 2 Chron. 29.11. Ezek. 44.11, 15. And though we have little more Account of them, than only in <hi>Jer.</hi> 35. yet there have we a plain Account of theſe <hi>Three great things concerning them.</hi> 1. The Inſtitution of their Progenitor. 2. Their Religious Obſervance for Three Hundred Years paſt. And, 3. the Approbation of both by Almighty God. The Inſtitution may be thought very ſevere; and the more, becauſe without any ſpecial manifeſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and, by conſequence, their ſo punctual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance rather Superſtitious than Reaſonable; and yet both are greatly approved by God: Whence it is very plain, that ſuch Inſtitutions, and the ſtrict Obſervance of them, are lawful, and well-pleaſing to God; and therefore that it is great Preſumption and Inconſiderateneſs to cenſure them as Superſtition. But the Evidence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:192035:11"/>of Truth hath extorted this Confeſſion from an Adverſary, and as Siniſter an Interpreter of theſe things, as he could well tell how to be; <hi>viz. That their Father gave them theſe Precepts for this very purpoſe, that thereby he might ſet them free from the Cares and the Pleaſures of the World, that ſo they might, with the more leiſure, imploy themſelves in the Study of the Scriptures, and of Divine Matters:</hi> Which was the very Buſineſs of the Chriſtian Monks. And if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in Being at the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as is believed; (as well it may, if we believe the Promiſe of God to them;) and that <hi>Simeon,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>James,</hi> Biſhop there, was one of them; there is no doubt but many of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Chriſtian Faith, and retained the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of their Progenitor, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inconſiſtent between them. Some of the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtand that of <hi>Zechar.</hi> 12.7. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſave the Tents of Juda firſt;</hi> of this People, becauſe they lived in Tents, came up with that Tribe out of the Wilderneſs, and are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned among them, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.55. and that <hi>the Lord ſhall ſave them firſt,</hi> becauſe to them the Meſſiah ſhall firſt be diſcovered. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Therapeuts,</hi> of whom <hi>Philo</hi> writes, and the firſt Converts by St. <hi>Mark</hi> about <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> might not be of thoſe People, may be conſidered.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:192035:12"/>
                  <p> It is true, we have no mention of them in the Goſpel; nor have we of the ESSEANS, who yet are known to have been a Religious Sect among the <hi>Jews,</hi> of great Antiquity, though not once mentioned in all the Scriptures; a People, who lived a Religious Abſtracted Life: But of them I ſhall ſay no more in this place, becauſe I intend the full Relations both of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and of <hi>Philo,</hi> concerning them hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Nor ſhall I here ſay any thing of the THE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAPEUTS, another Religious Society of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Philo</hi> ſaith, not only for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe I intend <hi>Philo</hi>'s Relation of them hereafter; but becauſe I conceive this no proper place for it: For I am well ſatisfied that they were ſome of thoſe who were firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſtianity, probably of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and poſſibly of the <hi>Eſſeans,</hi> notwithſtanding all the Cavils which ſome diſingenious and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Perſons have, in theſe laſt Ages, ſtrained their Wits to raiſe againſt it; though they might retain ſome Sentiments and Practices peculiar to themſelves for ſome time; as did they at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> as may be underſtood from <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1, 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.4, 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For, it is certain, they were never heard of before that time, nor any ſuch ſince, but <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who, from that time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited the ſame places; and from thence, after the Perſecution ceaſed, were the <hi>Aſcetick Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi> propagated to <hi>Paleſtin,</hi> and thoſe parts firſt, and afterward into <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:192035:12"/>
                  <p> The Precurſor to our Saviour, St. <hi>JOHN BAPTIST,</hi> according to the Prediction of the Angel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.15. was filled with the Holy Ghoſt even from his Mother's Womb, and drank neither Wine nor ſtrong Drink; had his Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Camels Hair, and a Leathern Girdle about his Loins; and his Meat was Locuſts and wild Honey, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.4. and was in the Deſert till the day of his Shewing unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Luk. 1.80. but in the Fifteenth Year of the Reign of <hi>Tiberius Coeſar, Annas</hi> and <hi>Cajaphas</hi> being the High Prieſts, the Word of God came unto him in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.1, 2. and being ſent of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6. he preached and baptized in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.3. and the People from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and all <hi>Judea</hi> went out to him, and were baptized of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.5, 6. This was a <hi>Life</hi> not only of <hi>Retirement</hi> and <hi>Abſtraction</hi> from the World, ſuch as was alſo that of the <hi>Coenobites,</hi> who lived in Religious Communities, but plainly an <hi>Eremetick,</hi> or <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick Life.</hi> And this being by one fill'd with the Holy Ghoſt from his Mother's Womb, and therefore by one raiſed up by Him, who had raiſed up the <hi>Nazarites</hi> before; with good cauſe do the ancient Chriſtian Writers repute Him a Prince of the Monks and Hermites raiſed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chriſtians; and ſo good cauſe, that they who oppoſe it, may ſeem to oppoſe not only the Sentiments and Opinions of Men, but,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:192035:13"/>out of Prejudice and miſguided Zeal, the very Acts of God, very diſingeniouſly and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately to ſerve a Party.</p>
                  <p>And for our <hi>SAVIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> Himſelf, though we have no particular Account of his Life till about the Thirtieth Year of his Age, yet we cannot queſtion but he did practice Himſelf what he did recommend to others; and that it was a Life of the Higheſt Perfection: The only particular of his Life before, that is left upon Record, is, That when he was Twelve Years Old, he tarried behind at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the Feaſt of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Mother knew not of it; and after Three Days was found in the Temple ſitting in the midſt of the Doctors, both hearing them, and asking them Queſtions; and that all who heard him were aſtoniſhed at his Underſtanding and Anſwers: and when his Mother asked him, why he had thus dealt with them; and told him, that they had ſought him ſorrowing; he reply'd, <hi>How is it that ye ſought me? Wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my Father's Buſineſs?</hi> and that he went down with them, and came to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and was ſubject to them. At his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> we ſee how careful he was to <hi>fulfill all Righteouſneſs</hi> Afterwards he declared to the <hi>Jews,</hi> That he <hi>ſought not his own Will, but the Will of the Father,</hi> who ſent him; and to his Diſciples, That it was his Food to do the Will of him who ſent him
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:192035:13"/>and to finiſh his Work, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 5.30: 4.34.) That he lived a Life of <hi>Poverty</hi> from his Birth, is very plain in the Evangelical Hiſtory; and that by his own choice, certainly no ingenuous Perſon will deny; and therefore of voluntary Poverty. And that he lived alſo a Life of <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> is not to be queſtioned. Much leſs that it was a Life of <hi>Abſtraction, Recollection,</hi> and continual Adherence to, and Communion with the Father. And all this being put together, and well conſidered, what was it other than a moſt perfect <hi>Aſcetick Life;</hi> the Great Exemplar ſo generouſly and heroickly Exemplified by thoſe many and numerous Choires of Holy <hi>Chriſtian Nazarites,</hi> of whom the World, eſpecially this Lazy, Tepid, Unprofitable, Senſual Generation, which deſpiſeth the Memory, and reproacheth the Common Name heretofore with them, and others venerable, is not worthy.</p>
                  <p>And this Life which he lived Himſelf, he did recommend to others, as by his own Illuſtrious Example, ſo alſo by his Doctrin: though he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned it to none, eſpecially in that high degree. For <hi>Chaſtity</hi> and <hi>Celebacie,</hi> he doth not barely approve it, but ſpeaks of it as a ſpecial Gift of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.11. which <hi>all cannot receive, ſave they to whom it is given.</hi> And when he had ſaid, <hi>There be Eunuchs, who have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heavens ſake;</hi> he adds, <hi>He that is able to receive it, let him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:192035:14"/>receive it:</hi> in both ſpeaking of ſomething more excellent than ordinary; and beſides, in theſe Words, <hi>There be Eunuchs, who have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Eunuchs,</hi> &amp;c. he plainly affirms, that it was a thing in Uſe and Practice at that time, (as it had been long before) which he ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and recommended to all, who could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. And concerning <hi>voluntary Poverty,</hi> to the Young Man, who deſired to know what he ſhould do that he might have Eternal Life; and had kept the Commandments from his Youth up; he replyed, one thing thou lackeſt; if thou wilt be <hi>Perfect,</hi> go and ſell whatſoever thou haſt, and give to the Poor, and thou ſhalt have Treaſure in Heaven; and come, take up the Croſs, and follow me, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.21. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.21. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.22. And <hi>Forſaking all,</hi> he maketh an indiſpenſible requiſite to the being his Diſciple: <hi>Whoſoever he be of you who forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Diſciple,</hi> Luk. 14.33. As to <hi>Religious Obedience, and voluntary Subjection to the Order and Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another well experienced in the Ways of God,</hi> for an Exerciſe of an intire Subjection of the Creature to the Creator, What elſe is it but a very proper and uſeful Mean and Expedient for the acquiring the Habit, and a continual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that great Doctrin of our Saviour, of <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> and taking up the Croſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.34. warranted and approved by God
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:192035:14"/>in the <hi>Recabites,</hi> and by our Saviour in his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Mother? Which, though <hi>Self-denial</hi> be a Precept, is a voluntary Act of the nature of a Reaſonable Free-will Offering; and a doing it daily, as is expreſſed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.23. a Living in it, and a continual Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Sacrifice of the prime Faculties of the Soul for the Service of God. And the whole Buſineſs of <hi>an abſtracted Aſcetick Life,</hi> What is it but a reaſonable, religious and devout Exerciſe of our Saviour's Doctrin, in his Admonition to <hi>Martha,</hi> Luk. 10.41, 42. againſt being careful and troubled about many things, when it was only for a ſhort Entertainment of Himſelf; and that One thing is needful; and that <hi>Mary</hi>'s Choice was of the better part? In his Sermon upon the Mount, of taking no thought for our Life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.25.—34. In his Parable of the Sower, concerning the Cares, and Riches, and Pleaſures of this Life; the Thorns which choak the Seed of the Word, that it bringeth no Fruit to Perfection, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.14. and concerning Watching, that we be not ſurprized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.42: 25.13. <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.35. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.36.</p>
                  <p>And now, if any one pleaſe, as many have done, to make any queſtion concerning the meaning of our Saviour, or the Interpretation of any part of this, what more Authentick Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of that can be reaſonably deſired than what the wiſeſt of Men have always approved
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:192035:15"/>and had recourſe to in ſuch Caſes, Uſage and Practice afterward; which daily Experience in the Conſtruction of Laws, and ancient Records and Deeds, doth ſufficiently confirm. The APOSTLES certainly practiſed all this, as far as was conſiſtent with their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Buſineſs they were imployed in; and Preached it, and recommended it by their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin too, as far as the Circumſtances of the People and the Times would bear. They for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook all; not one of them Married any Wife afterward, though they might have done it; and were ſo far abſtracted from all Diverſions and Diſtractions of the World, that they ordered Deacons for other neceſſary Works, that they might give themſelves continually to Prayer, and to the Miniſtery of the Word, or to Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And the effect of their Preaching, and of the powerful Operation of the Holy Spirit upon the People, was, that <hi>they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrin, in Communion in breaking Bread, and in Prayers. And all that believed were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and had all things Common; and ſold their Poſſeſſions and Goods, and parted them as every Man had need,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. And again, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32. <hi>The Multitude of them that believed, were of one Heart, and of one Soul; neither ſaid any of them, that ought of the things which he poſſeſſed, was his own, but they had all things Common:</hi> For <hi>as many as were Poſſeſſors of Lands or Houſes, ſold them,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:192035:15"/>and brought the Prices of the things that were ſold, and laid them down at the Apoſtles Feet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is here briefly ſaid of the <hi>firſt Converts</hi> and <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> agrees ſo well, all things conſidered with what <hi>Philo</hi> more largely relates concerning thoſe about <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> whom he calls THERAPEUTS, who were never heard of before, nor after, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Denomination, unleſs of that of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> which began early at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and was ſoon ſpread over the World where any Diſciples of Chriſt were, and took place of all others, that, as the Ancients do affirm, we alſo have great reaſon to reſt ſatisfied, that they were indeed ſuch, notwithſtanding all the Cavils of ſome of the laſt Age, which have ſince been ſufficiently refuted. It is true, they did not long appear in that form of Communities; for they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and diſperſed into divers Regions by that great Perſecution, after the Death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and, doubtleſs, by like Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in other Places: But the Example and Doctrin of our Saviour and his Apoſtles could not but provoke many, eſpecially among the <hi>Jews,</hi> before well-diſpoſed for it, to forſake the World, and betake themſelves to a retired, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, Contemplative Life. The Natural Inclination in them was excited and fortified by the various Examples which were common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them before; and then receiving ſuch
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:192035:16"/>further Encouragement from our Saviour and his Apoſtles, both directly and indirectly, from ſeveral Doctrines of the Goſpel, concerning <hi>Self-denyal, Mortification, Contempt of the World, Heavenly-mindedneſs,</hi> &amp;c. this could not but mightily affect them generally with an Heroick Contempt of the World, and of the Body, and all Earthly things: The very <hi>Doctrin, Promiſes,</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> with which they were confirmed, were apt, of their own Nature, to produce all this; but much more, being accompanied with ſuch a Spirit and Power, as the Preaching of the Apoſtles and the Primitive Chriſtians then was. And certainly they wanted nothing but Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, even then in the Apoſtles times, to have ſettled in <hi>Coenobitical Societies;</hi> which as ſoon as the commom obſtacle, the Perſecutions, was removed, by the Providence of God, in raiſing <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to the Throne of the Empire, they preſently began to do, firſt in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where, 'tis probable, were many deſcended from the <hi>Recabites</hi> and <hi>Eſſeans,</hi> and in no long time after in moſt other Parts. Concerning thoſe in <hi>Egypt</hi> in his time, St. <hi>John Chryſoſtome</hi> gives us this Account: <q>Should any one come now to the Deſerts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he would ſee all the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs altogether more excellent than a Paradice, and innumerable Companies of Angels ſhining in Mortal Bodies. For there is to be ſeen ſpread over all that Region the Camp of Chriſt, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:192035:16"/>the admirable Royal Flock, and the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Heavenly Powers illuſtriouſly ſhining upon Earth. And this you may ſee moſt ſplendid, not in MEN only, but alſo in WOMEN. Heaven it ſelf doth not ſo ſhine with various Conſtellations of Stars, as <hi>Egypt</hi> is beſet and illuſtrated with innumerable Convents of Monks and Virgins:</q> But of this more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being well conſidered, it will be very plain, 1. That they who have derived theſe Religious Inſtitutions from our Saviour and his Apoſtles, by their Example and Doctrin, and the Inſpiration of the Holy Spirit, had a good Foundation of Truth to maintain their Aſſertion. 2. That they who have raiſed ſuch Prejudice in the Minds of the People againſt ſuch Holy, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Societies in general, as to beget in them an Odium againſt all; if they did it in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and meerly through the Prejudice they themſelves had conceived from the Scandals of thoſe of their time, yet did they very raſhly and inconſiderately in ſo doing: but if they did it to temporize and ingratiate themſelves with Princes and Great Men, who had inriched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Spoils of the Monaſteries, and the Revenues of the Church, they did very wickedly and impiouſly. We muſt not deny or queſtion the Juſtice of the Judgment of God upon them: but, Who are they by whom
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:192035:17"/>the Righteous God doth uſually execute ſuch Judgments? And at this time we have great reaſon to take that for a Warning to our Selves. Were they caſt out for their Lazineſs and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions? What then have we to expect? Suppoſe ye that they were Sinners above all that have ſucceeded them? <hi>I tell you, Nay; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye Repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> God is able to reſtore them again: <hi>The Vineyard ſhall be taken from you, and given to other Husband-men, who ſhall render him their Fruits in their Seaſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Thought I had done here: For though I know many have written very bitterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Monkery,</hi> I thought them not worth the looking into: becauſe I believed the Truth, which I have aſſerted, will ſtand as an impregnable Rock againſt all their Blaſts. Yet, at laſt, it coming into my mind, that an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perſon of great Learning, Judgment, Piety and Candor, of this Church of <hi>England,</hi> had written ſomething to like purpoſe, I thought fit to look into him; and finding, to my Sorrow for him, but great Satisfaction in this Caſe, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of himſelf, and of how little weight it is, which he hath ſaid againſt them, I intended to have ſpared his Name, and to have paſſed it over with a ſhort Note that it needed not, nor deſerved an Anſwer. But conſidering that that is only the way of the World; that we ought to ſacrifice all Eſteem of Men, whether our ſelves
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:192035:17"/>or others, to the Truth, and to the Service of God, and of Men too, for their Admonition; and that the Holy Scriptures ſpare not to record the Failings of Holy Men; I reſolved to do the like. To be plain therefore, that Excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Mr. <hi>Joſeph Meed,</hi> having concluded <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy of the latter times,</hi> fore-told, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. to be the Worſhip of Saints introduced into the Chriſtian Church, through the Hypocriſie of Lyars, forbidding to Marry, and commanding to abſtain from Meats; to make good his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of that firſt part of the Prediction, and make it compleat, concludes the latter part to be underſtood of <hi>Monks,</hi> that they were the chief Advancers of Saints Worſhip: And to prove this, he produceth the Teſtimony of <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> a known Adverſary to them, who lived about 1200 Years after the time he ſpeaks of; and <hi>Eunapius,</hi> (a known Enemy not only to them, but to all Chriſtians) whom he calls <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Catiffe, and damned Dog.</hi> And why ſo? Why, becauſe he <hi>blaſphemes the Saints and Servants of Christ, who loved not their Lives unto Death, the Dust of whoſe Feet he was not worthy to lick up.</hi> Competent Witneſſes indeed; and a ſpecial Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony this: but he adds: <hi>Yet may we make a ſhift to gather hence,</hi> &amp;c. But without Shifts we may ſee plainly to what Shifts his unadviſed and prepoſterous Zeal had reduced him, thus to expoſe the Weakneſs of the Cauſe he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:192035:18"/>when all his Learning, Diligence, and Inquiry, and all Antiquity, could afford him no better Evidence; and to expoſe himſelf to the ſame Cenſure he had deſervedly given to his own Witneſs. Had they been Monks and only Monks, who had been guilty of this, had it been fair to caſt an Aſperſion upon all? and, Was it fair, within a dozen Lines after, to print <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Monks</hi> in different Characters, while both were under the ſame Circumſtances? At this rate, What Calumnies might not be raiſed againſt the People of God in all Ages; the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the very <hi>Apoſtles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſuch as pretend moſt of all to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation?</hi> The Devil hath always ſowed his Tares, and moſt induſtriouſly amongſt the beſt. But upon this Evidence, there is no queſtion but the Accuſed will be acquitted by all impartial Judges.</p>
                  <p>As to what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of <hi>ſome Hypocrites rambling about in the Habit of Monks,</hi> it is very diſingeniouſly, not to ſay diſhoneſtly, alledged concerning <hi>Monks in general.</hi> But St <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Mind concerning the <hi>Monks of his time</hi> is ſo plain in what follows, that I need ſay no more of it in this place. And for further anſwer to this Abuſe of his Teſtimony, they who pleaſe may peruſe it in his own Words upon <hi>Pſ.</hi> 99. <hi>&amp;</hi> 132. and <hi>Ep.</hi> 137. And the ſame may be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Gregory of Towers.</hi> v. <hi>Caſſian. Coll.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 16.</p>

                  <p> He had unhappily concluded before, that thoſe Words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> are a Deſcription of <hi>Monkery;</hi> and when that Conceit was once fixed in his Mind, it preſently ſet all his Parts and all his Learning to work to prove it to others; and gave eaſie admittance to all that might ſeem to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it. Hence it was that he imagins <hi>Abſtaining from Meats</hi> may comprehend <hi>Renouncing of Poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions.</hi> Nor could he otherwiſe have thought that the <hi>Monks</hi> did any more<note n="*" place="bottom">It was <hi>Conc.

There is a great difference between a Prohibition of Impoſitions, and a Prohibition of a free and voluntary Act. But how doth Prejudice blind Mens Minds! That a Man of his Parts, of his Learning, of his Judgment, Candor, and Generoſity in aſſerting the Truth in other matters, ſhould be ſo affected
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:192035:19"/>with a meer Imagination of his own, as to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that, to do ſuch an Indignity to ſo glorious a part of the Chriſtian Church, which St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> calls <hi>the moſt Choice and Wiſeſt part of the Church;</hi> and St. <hi>Hierom, the Flower of the Church,</hi> which produced ſo many Glorious Saints of ſo great Virtue, and adorned with ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and illuſtrious Graces; produced ſo many Biſhops, innumerable, and amongſt them the moſt illuſtrious Lights of the Church, both for Virtue and Learning; was ſo much reſpected not only by the People, but by the beſt of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperours, and approved and favoured by the moſt Eminent Biſhops of the Church, and hath ſo many Teſtimonies of their Excellence by Perſons of the greateſt Credit and Reputation, and deſerved ſo well in many reſpects; that ſuch a Man, for the ſake of a Phanſie of his own, ſhould ſet up a <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> a prejudiced Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to them; and <hi>Eunapius,</hi> a Pagan Adverſary to the Chriſtians, againſt ſuch a Cloud of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and ſo wreſt &amp; ſtrain the Holy Scriptures, and thereby ſo expoſe himſelf to juſt Cenſure, is one of the moſt remarkable Inſtances of the Miſchief of Prejudice that I can think of: an Edifying inſtance to make all Men, good Men, learned Men, and wiſe Men, jealous of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and cautious that they do not impoſe upon themſelves; not to do God Service: for he needs no ſuch Shifts, nor is at any time pleaſed with them.</p>

At <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> they do, as before, cauſing their Gueſts to ſup with them, if by fortune any come.

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is received to the common Table, firſt he is <hi>to proteſt</hi> ſolemnly to honour and ſerve God with all his Heart; to obſerve Juſtice and Fidelity towards all Men; never willing to hurt any Man, nor injure any for another Man's Command; but always to hate the Wicked, and aſſiſt the Good; to keep his Faith to all, but eſpecially to his <hi>Superiours;</hi> becauſe they hold their Power from God. To which they add, that if he be put in Authority over others, he never will abuſe it, to the Prejudice of thoſe who are under him, and neither exceed the reſt in Apparel, nor any other ambitious Pomp: that he will always love the Truth, and ſeverely reprove Lyars: and that he will keep his Hands and Soul pure from all Theft and unjuſt Gain:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192035:23"/>and that he will not conceal any Myſteries, or Secrets of their Religion, from his Companions, nor reveal them to any Strangers, although he ſhould be threaten'd thereto by Death. Adding moreover, that he will never deliver any Doctrin, ſave that which he hath received; and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently preſerve the Books, as well as the Names, of thoſe from whom they received it. Theſe <hi>Proteſtations</hi> they oblige thoſe to take ſolemnly, who enter into their Order, to the end to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them againſt all Vices.</p>

For which cauſe oftentimes they are moved with Compaſſion to receive ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into their Order again, when ready, by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, to yield up the Ghoſt; judging them to have endured Penance enough for their Offences, who, with Famine, were almoſt brought to Death's door. They are very ſevere and juſt in <hi>their Judgments;</hi> and to decide any Matter, there is never fewer of them than an Hundred, and that which is by them agreed upon is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable. Next after God they reverence <hi>their Law-giver,</hi> inſomuch, that if any one revile him, they forthwith condemn him to Death.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:192035:24"/>They take it for a great Duty <hi>to obey their Elders,</hi> and what is appointed by many; ſo that if Ten of them ſit together, no Man of them muſt ſpeak, without he be licenſed thereto by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>And they are more ſevere than any other <hi>Jews</hi> in obſerving the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> for they do not only abſtain from dreſſing Meat (which they dreſs the Evening before) that Day; but alſo, they may not remove any Veſſel out of its place, nor ſatisfie the Neceſſities of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Upon other Days they dig a Pit, a foot deep in the Ground, with the Hatchet which (as we before ſaid) every one, at his Entrance into their Order, hath given him; and then covering themſelves diligently with their Garment, as if they feared to be Irreverent to the Light of Heaven; in that Pit they eaſe themſelves, and then cover their Ordure with the Earth they took out of the Pit: and this they do in the moſt ſecret places. And though this purging of their Bodies be natural, yet do they, by waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, purifie themſelves after it, as after great Uncleanneſs.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, amongſt themſelves they are divided into <hi>Four Orders,</hi> according to the time which they have continu'd this Exerciſe of Life: and they that are Juniors bear ſuch reſpect to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:192035:24"/>their <hi>Seniors,</hi> that if they do but touch one of them, they are obliged to purifie themſelves, as though they had touched a Stranger.</p>
                  <p>They are <hi>long liv'd,</hi> ſo that moſt of them live an Hundred Years; which I judge is, by reaſon of their well-ordered Diet, and their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</p>
                  <p>They contemn <hi>Adverſity,</hi> and by Conſtancy and Fortitude triumph over Torments. They preferr an honourable Death before Life. The Wars which the <hi>Jews</hi> made againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhew'd what invinſible <hi>Courage</hi> and Hardineſs they have in all things; for they ſuffered the Breaking of the Members of their Bodies, Fire and Sword, and all kind of Tortures, rather than be brought to ſpeak the leaſt Word againſt their Law-giver, or to eat Meats forbidden. They could not be forced to any of theſe, neither would they entreat the Torturers, nor ſhew any Sorrow amidſt their Torments. Yea, in the midſt of their Pains they ſcoffed at their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, and joyfully yielded up their Souls, as though they hoped to paſs to a better Life.</p>
                  <p>For it is an <hi>Opinion</hi> amongſt them, That the Body is mortal and corruptible, but the <hi>Souls</hi> remain ever immortal; and being of a moſt pure and etherial Subſtance, wrap themſelves in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as in Priſons, being drawn thereunto by ſome natural Inclination: But when they are delivered out of theſe carnal Bonds, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:192035:25"/>as freed from a long Bondage, they joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mount into the Air. And of the Good Souls they ſay, as did the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that they live beyond the Ocean in a place of Pleaſure, where they are never moleſted with Rain, nor Snow, nor Heat; but have always a ſweet and pleaſant Air. But the Wicked Souls (as they ſay) go into a Place very tempeſtuous, where there is always Winter Weather, always Lamentations of thoſe who for ever are to be puniſhed. For I judge that the <hi>Greeks</hi> are of this Opinion, when they ſay there is an Iſle for the Virtuous, whom they call <hi>Heroes</hi> and <hi>Half-Gods;</hi> and that the Souls of the Wicked go to a Place in Hell, where it is feigned, that ſome are tormented, as <hi>Syſiphus, Tantalus, Ixion,</hi> and <hi>Titius.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Eſſeans</hi> alſo believe that they are created Immortal, that they may be induced to Vertue, and averted from Vice; that the Good are rendred better in this Life, by the Hope of being Happy after Death; and that the Wicked, who imagin they can hide their Evil Actions in this World, are puniſhed for them in the other with Eternal Torments. This is the <hi>Eſſeans</hi> Opinion, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Excellence of the Soul; from which we ſee very few of thoſe depart, who have once em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo ſome among them, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <hi>to foretell things to come:</hi> which Faculty is obtained as well by the Study of Holy Books
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:192035:25"/>and Ancient Prophecies, as by the Care they take of ſanctifying themſelves: And their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi> ſeldom fail.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>They are, at leaſt, <hi>Four Thouſand</hi> in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who have neither <hi>Wives</hi> nor <hi>Slaves;</hi> ſuppoſing that <hi>Women</hi> are the occaſion of Injuſtice, and <hi>Slaves</hi> do cauſe Inſurrections; and living apart by themſelves, they ſerve one another; and chuſe out certain upright Men among the Prieſts, to gather the Fruits and Revenues of the Land, to the end they may be maintained and nouriſhed thereby. In a Word, they follow the ſame Courſe of Life that they do, who are called <hi>Pliſti</hi> among the <hi>Danes.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>There is <hi>another ſort of Eſſeans,</hi> agreeing with the former, both in Apparel, Diet, and kind of Life, and Obſervance of the ſame Laws and Ordinances; only they differ in the Matter of <hi>Marriage:</hi> Affirming, that to abſtain from Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage tends to aboliſh Man-kind. For (ſay they) if all Men ſhould follow this Opinion, preſently all Man-kind would periſh. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, theſe People uſe ſuch Moderation, that for Three Years ſpace they obſerve the Women they intend to Marry; and then, if they appear ſound enough to bear Children, they Marry them. None of them lye with their Wives when they are with Child; to ſhew that they do not Marry to ſatisfie Luſt, but to have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:192035:26"/>Children. When their Wives waſh themſelves they are covered with a Garment, as the Men are: And this is the Manner and Cuſtom of this Sect.</p>

Hence it is that both the <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land</hi> are full of <hi>Wealthy,</hi> and <hi>Vain-glorious,</hi> and <hi>Voluptuous</hi> Men. Whereas the Number of <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Righteous,</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> Men, is very ſmall. But though that which is ſmall is rare, yet it is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:192035:26"/>not quite not exiſting in Nature. This both <hi>Greece</hi> and the <hi>Barbarous</hi> Countries can atteſt: For, in <hi>Greece</hi> did flouriſh thoſe who were truly call'd the <hi>Seven Wiſe Men,</hi> (beſides whom, others alſo, as is very probable, flouriſh'd, both before and ſince them) whoſe Memory, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they were the <hi>Ancienter,</hi> has not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd; though, the Memory of the <hi>later</hi> of them, through the great Neglect of their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries,</hi> lies in Obſcurity. And in other Kingdoms were many <hi>Ancients,</hi> venerable both for their <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> even numerous <hi>Armies</hi> (if I may ſo ſay, becauſe of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Vertue) of Good and Excellent Men. Such among the <hi>Perſians</hi> are the <hi>Magi,</hi> who diving into the Works of Nature for the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, are quietly, by much Leiſure and Opportunity, inſtructed in Sacred things; and do alſo teach others the Divine Virtues by clearer Demonſtrations.

                  <p>They dwell only in little <hi>Villages,</hi> avoiding <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and great <hi>Towns,</hi> becauſe of the Immoralities of the Inhabitants of ſuch Places, being very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that <hi>Souls</hi> receive an incurable Wound from the <hi>Converſation of ſuch</hi> Men; juſt as our <hi>Bodies</hi> imbibe a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> from <hi>corruptive</hi> Air.

                  <p>None of them hoard up Gold and Silver, or poſſeſs great Eſtates of Land out of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs of Revenues; but they are all contented with what will juſt ſupply the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of Life.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:192035:30"/>of them which have not Relations, leave them to their Friends and Acquaintance. The <hi>Greeks</hi> celebrate <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi> becauſe they, being ſmote with the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> let their Eſtates be devour'd by Sheep. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire thoſe Men, becauſe they themſelves were above Riches: But, How much better were thoſe, who, not ſuffering their Eſtates to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by Cattle, apply'd a Remedy to the Needs of Men, and made the Indigent Rich? for that was an inconſiderable (not to ſay Mad) Act, for which <hi>Greece</hi> admir'd thoſe Men: But this is a ſober Cuſtom, which ſhews much Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, Prudence, Humanity, and Sweetneſs of Diſpoſition. What can Enemies do more than devour and make the Countries of their Enemies bare of <hi>Corn, Fodder,</hi> and <hi>Trees,</hi> that being brought into the ſtraits of Neceſſity, they may yield. Juſt thus did <hi>Democritus</hi> ſerve his Kindred, contriving, as it were, with his own Hands Streights and Poverty for them, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly perhaps, but by not fore-caſting and having in his Eye the Benefit of others: How much better are theſe, though the Efforts of their Affections for Philoſophy were not leſs than his. Theſe preferr'd an extenſive Concern and Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of Mind before Contempt of their Friends, benefitting others with their Eſtates, and not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a corrupt uſe of them, that they might benefit both themſelves and others; others, by

                     <hi>ample Eſtates;</hi> themſelves, by <hi>Philoſophizing;</hi> becauſe the Cares of <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi> devour much Time: But 'tis an excellent thing to be frugal of Time, ſince, as the Phyſician <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> ſaid, <hi>Life is ſhort, but Art long.</hi> But to proceed in our Narration.</p>
                  <p>When they quit their Eſtates, and are no longer caught by any Baits, they depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever turning back, and <hi>leave their Brethren, Children, Wives, Parents, numerous Relations, friendly Intimacies</hi> and <hi>Engagements,</hi> and the <hi>Countries</hi> in which they were bred and born; becauſe <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Familiarity</hi> are very attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and have the greateſt Power to enſnare. And when they do thus, they do not remove into another City, like miſerable, unfortunate Servants, who, inſtead of Exchanging <hi>Slavery</hi> for <hi>Liberty,</hi> only exchange their Maſters; for, indeed, ſuch are they, who part with one Eſtate, to purchaſe another in ſome other City; for every City much inhabited (though it be govern'd by Good Laws) is full of unſpeakable Tumults and Hurries, which any one that is once led by Wiſdom can't away with: But they live and exerciſe themſelves without Walls, in Gardens and By-Fields, ſeeking after <hi>Solitude,</hi> not out of a moroſe affected Diſguſt againſt Men; but becauſe they are ſenſible Mixtures are unprofitable and hurtful, by reaſon of the Diſ-agreeableneſs of their Manners.</p>

                  <p> This ſort of Men are <hi>in all parts</hi> of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable World; and, indeed, 'twas but fitting that both <hi>Greece</hi> and the <hi>Barbarous World</hi> ſhould partake of this perfectly good Sect.</p>
                  <p>They abound in <hi>Egypt</hi> in every one of their Provinces, and eſpecially about <hi>Alexandria:</hi> But the <hi>principal of them</hi> retire, as to their own Countrey, <hi>from all Parts,</hi> to a <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>Therapeuts,</hi> at a commodious Place about the Lake <hi>Maria,</hi> ſituate upon a little riſing Hill, and very convenient both for <hi>Security,</hi> and good <hi>Temperature of Air.</hi> As for Security, that Place is beſt which is ſurrounded with Neighbouring Villages and Cottages: And as for good, well-tempered Air, continual Gales, which proceed from a Lake that lies open to the Sea, and that part of the Sea which is nigh furniſh them with that; for the Sea ſends fine, thin Gales, and the Lake, which lies open to the Sea, thick, fat Gales; which two, ſo curiouſly mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, make a very Healthy Air.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Houſes</hi> in which they live together are very mean and ſlight, and juſt ſerve for Defence againſt two very neceſſary things, the <hi>Scorching</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> &amp; the <hi>cold Crudeneſs</hi> of the <hi>Air:</hi> But they are not near together, as the Houſes in the Cities; for Neighbourhoods are troubleſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to thoſe who court Retirement: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they far diſtant from each other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they love Communion and Society toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

                  <p>In every Houſe they have an <hi>Oratory</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, call'd a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> and <hi>Monaſtry;</hi> in which, alone by themſelves, they celebrate the <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of a <hi>Sacred</hi> Life, never bringing thither any ſuch thing as Meat, or Drink, or any other things elſe which are neceſſary for the Repairs of Nature's Decays; but only <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>inſpired Oracles,</hi> which were ſpoken by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> and other things by which <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> are encreaſed and perfected. They always preſerve an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Remembrance of God;</hi> ſo that even in their <hi>Dreams</hi> their Fancies form and preſent them with no other Images, but the Beauties of the Divine Powers. Hence many ſpeak out in their <hi>Sleep,</hi> and whilſt they are dreaming do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the venerable Decrees of the Holy Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. They are us'd to <hi>Pray</hi> twice every Day, <hi>viz.

All the ſpace of Time between the Morning and Evening, they give themſelves to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:192035:32"/>Exerciſe: For reading the moſt <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> they Philoſophize, <hi>Allegorizing</hi> the Philoſophy of their Anceſtours: For they interpret the Compoſure of a plain literal Senſe, as the Symbols [or Signatures] of a ſecret or concealed Nature, by probable Conjectures. They have alſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures of Ancient Men, who, being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Promoters of this Sect, have left Monuments of this Model in their Allegories, which they make uſe of as certain <hi>Archetypals,</hi> imitating the Manner of their Deſign; ſo that they don't only contemplate. Moreover, they alſo make <hi>Songs</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> upon God, of all ſorts of Meaſures and Tunes, to which they are obliged to prick the Graver ſort of Notes. <hi>Six Days</hi> together every one of them apart Philoſophize by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Cells, never going over the threſhold, nor ſo much as peeping out; but on the <hi>Seventh Days</hi> they meet together in a common Body and ſit down together in Order, according to their Age, in a very decent Poſture, keeping their Hands out of ſight; to wit, their right Hand between the Breaſt and their Chin, and the left Hand upon the Cavity of their right Side: The Eldeſt and Experteſt of them, when he is come, diſcourſes to them with a fix'd Eye, and a ſteddy Voice, with Reaſoning and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not affecting out of Oſtentation Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in Words, like <hi>Oratours</hi> and <hi>Sophiſters;</hi> but with great Searchingneſs of Thought, and

All the reſt hear the Exhortation with Silence, ſignifying their Approbation only by Motions of their Eye or Head.</p>
                  <p>The common <hi>Temple,</hi> in which they meet together on <hi>Seventh Days,</hi> has Two Incloſures; one being alotted for the <hi>Men,</hi> call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; the other for <hi>Women,</hi> call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; for the Women ordinarily hear together with them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame Emulation and Purpoſe. The Wall which parts the Encloſures is built about three or four Cubits high from the Pavement, like a Fortreſs, being higher up open to the top. By this Contrivance the Female Sex preſerve that Modeſty which becomes them, and hear well enough as they ſit in the Auditory, becauſe nothing hinders the Voice of the Speaker.</p>
                  <p>They firſt lay <hi>Temperance</hi> in the Soul, as it were for a Foundation, and raiſe a Superſtructure of other Vertues upon that. Not one of them uſes any Meat or Drink before Sun-ſet; for they reckon the Exerciſe of Philoſophy worthy of the Day; but Bodily Neceſſities to belong to Darkneſs: Wherefore, they beſtow their Days upon that, and ſome ſmall part of the Night upon theſe. Some of them having a peculiar Deſire after Knowledge raiſed in them, forget to <hi>Eat</hi> for Three Days together: And others
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:192035:34"/>are ſo luxuriouſly and deliciouſly cheered and feaſted by Wiſdom, ſupplying them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally with Sentiments, that they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their Appetites double that time, and hardly taſte the leaſt neceſſary Food for Six Days together, being us'd (as they ſay of a certain ſort of <hi>Graſhoppers</hi>) to be fed by Air; for their Singing makes Want very eaſie.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe they reckon the <hi>Seventh Day</hi> all Holy and all Feſtival, they vouchſafe it a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Honour; for after the Care of the Soul, they anoint the Body alſo, allowing it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation, juſt as they do their Cattle, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Toyl. They <hi>eat</hi> nothing that is coſtly, but feed upon <hi>cheap</hi> Bread, and Salt: Thoſe of them that live <hi>deliciouſly,</hi> dreſs it with Hyſſop. Their <hi>Drink</hi> is Spring-Water. Thus they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe thoſe Two <hi>Tyranneſſes,</hi> Hunger and Thirſt, which Nature hath placed over [or under] the Mortal kind, bringing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to allure them, but only ſuch things as are needful, without which 'tis not poſſible to live. For this Reaſon they eat that they may not be hungry, and drink that they may not thirſt; but they avoid <hi>Fulneſs</hi> and <hi>Satiety,</hi> as the Enemy and Traitour both of Soul and Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Covering</hi> being of Two kinds, namely, <hi>Cloaths,</hi> and a <hi>Dwelling-Place;</hi> (having acquainted you that their <hi>Dwellings</hi> are mean, made without Art, of what-ever comes to hand, and only for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:192035:35"/>uſe) I come now to acquaint you, that their <hi>Raiment</hi> alſo is very mean, worn only for Defence againſt Cold and Heat: They have a <hi>thick Cloak</hi> over ſome <hi>rough Skin</hi> or other, in Winter; and in Summer, a lighter ſhort Garment over their Shoulder, or <hi>Linnen.</hi> They alſo exerciſe themſelves to a perfect Freedom from all Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and Vanity, knowing very well that Falſhood is the beginning of Tumour, and that Truth is the Source of the Avoidance of vain Pomp and Oſtentation; and that both theſe have the Nature of their different Spring and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; for from Falſhood flow numerous and divers <hi>Idea's</hi> [or kinds] of Evils; but from Truth, a great Abundance of both Humane and Divine Goods.</p>
                  <p>The manner of their <hi>Feaſting</hi> is thus; For Seven Weeks together they aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which they do not only out of Reſpect to the Number <hi>Seven,</hi> but alſo to the Power of it; for they know it to be a chaſt and Virgin Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. This Feſtival is a Preparatory to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Feaſt, <hi>(viz. Pentecoſt,)</hi> ſo called for its belonging to the Number <hi>Fifty,</hi> which is the moſt Holy and Natural Number, becauſe of the Power of a right-angled Triangle, which is the Principle of the Production of all things. When they are met together, array'd in White, as ſoon as the <hi>Ephemereuts</hi> (for that is the Name they call their Beadles by) give the Sign, all
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:192035:35"/>of them, before they ſit down to eat, ſtanding in a very decent Order, with all Gravity, do, with their Eyes and Hands lifted up to Heaven, (their Eyes, becauſe they have been taught to ſee things ſo worthy of Veneration; their Hands, to ſignifie that they are not guilty of Eating any Food before, out of pretence of Neceſſity) pray to God that their Banquetting may pleaſe Him, and be according to his Mind, or [accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to underſtanding.] The <hi>Seniors</hi> ſit down according to their <hi>Admiſſions;</hi> for they don't reckon thoſe who have liv'd many Years, and are very Ancient, the Seniors there; but, on the contrary, they look upon them as Young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if they have but lately been enamour'd with that way of Living; but they count thoſe who began betime, in the Flower of their Age, to betake themſelves to the <hi>Contemplative</hi> part of Philoſophy (which, indeed, is the beſt and Divineſt part) their Seniors, though their Youth be not yet expir'd. The <hi>Women</hi> alſo are at the Feaſt with them, many of which are very Ancient, and Virgins out of pure Love to <hi>Purity,</hi> not out of Neceſſity, as ſome of the Prieſteſſes amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who live ſo upon that Account, rather than out of free Choice: No; theſe live ſo becauſe of a true Zeal for, and deſire of Wiſdom; for, having a fervent deſire to live by Wiſdom, they make no account of Bodily Pleaſures; neither do they deſire <hi>Mortal,</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:192035:36"/>but <hi>Immortal</hi> Off-ſprings, which only a Soul that truly loves God is able to bring forth out of its ſelf; for 'tis God who has ſhed into it the <hi>Intellectual</hi> Rayes of the <hi>Father,</hi> by which 'twill be able to contemplate the Decrees of Wiſdom. When they ſit together, the Men ſit on the Right hand, and the Women on the Left. If any one ſuppoſes that ſofter <hi>Seats</hi> than ordinary (though not ſo coſtly) were prepared for ſuch Noble, Virtuous Exerciſers of Vertue; let him know, that they have cheap ſort of Carpets made of ſome Leaves and Barks of Trees that grow there, on which they lean a little; for they remit ſomething of the hard way of Living that the <hi>Lacedoemonians</hi> uſe; though, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, they ſtudy <hi>Frugality,</hi> and have a ſtrong <hi>Antipathy</hi> againſt the <hi>Philtres</hi> of Pleaſure. They are not waited upon by <hi>Slaves;</hi> for they look upon the keeping of Servants to be a Cuſtom againſt Nature; for ſhe made and brought forth all Men free. But the Iniquity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Covetings of thoſe who have affected <hi>Inequality,</hi> the Ring-leader of all Miſchief, have brought Camps into the World, and ſet the ſtronger Men on Fire, to exert their Strength againſt the Weak. Here, as I ſaid, is no Servant; but Free-Men give all neceſſary Attendance, which they do heartily, and with all readineſs, even to the Prevention of Requeſt; for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors of the Company, which are appointed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:192035:36"/>from Meal to Meal, do, with all Diligence, ſerve thoſe who have arrived to a great pitch of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, (juſt as Natural Sons do, with great Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Emulation, ſerve their Parents) reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe their common Parents to be nearer related to them than their Parents by Blood, ſince nothing is nearer than <hi>Integrity</hi> to thoſe who have right Minds. Thoſe that wait come with their Garments looſe about them, leſt there ſhould be the leaſt Appearance of Servility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them at this Feaſt. I know ſome will laugh at the Hearing of this; but they are ſuch as do thoſe things for which they ought to weep and lament. At thoſe Feaſts no <hi>Wine</hi> is brought in, but only very clear <hi>Water;</hi> cold Water for the moſt, and warm Water for the Tendereſt of the Old Men. Their Table is pure from all <hi>Bloody Creatures;</hi> Loaves are their <hi>Meat,</hi> and Salt is their <hi>Sauce.</hi> The moſt dainty of them, indeed, make it more palatable with <hi>Hyſſop;</hi> for Right Reaſon charges them, like <hi>Prieſts,</hi> to ſacrifice <hi>Sacrifices</hi> without Wine, and to live upon them; for <hi>Wine</hi> is an incentive of Folly, and <hi>chargable Diſhes</hi> provoke Luſt, which is the moſt Inſatiable of all Beaſts. And ſo much for the Firſt part.</p>
                  <p>After the Gueſts are ſat in the Orders fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, the <hi>Waiters</hi> do ſtand decently in Order, ready to ſerve. There is no <hi>Drink</hi> brought, but every one calls for it as he wants
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:192035:37"/>it; and, which is more than any thing already mentioned, no one dares <hi>Belch,</hi> or fetch his Breath indecently: But ſome body either offers a Query upon ſome place of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> or ſolves ſomething propos'd by another without any Solicitude about the manner of the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for not one amongſt them deſires Fame by fine <hi>Speaking:</hi> But every one loves to ſee another more exact; and when they ſee him ſo, not to envy him, though they are not ſo accute themſelves. They have all the like Deſire to learn. Sometimes one of them takes more time when he teaches, repeating and dwelling upon what he ſays, that he may imprint his Notions on their Souls; for, many times, the Mind of the Auditors being not able to keep pace with the Interpretation of one that ſpeaks too cloſely, or too faſt, falls ſhort of comprehending what is ſaid; the reſt look with their Faces upright upon him who ſpeaks, in one and the ſame Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and give Notice of their Underſtanding and Comprehending what they hear by a Nod, or a Look. They diſcover their Commendation by the continued Cheerfulneſs of their Aſpect; but a Doubt is ſignify'd by a ſtiller Motion of the Head, and their Right hand's little Finger. The <hi>Juniors</hi> alſo that wait give no leſs Attention than thoſe that ſit at Table. Their Expoſitions of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> are Allegorical Hints; for the whole Conſtitution of their Law ſeems to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:192035:37"/>them like an Animal; in which the literal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, are the Body; and the inviſible Senſe infolded in the Words, the Mind; wherein the Reaſonable Soul begins diſtinctly to conſider the Properties thereof, as through the Perſpective of the Names, after it (having beheld the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Beauties of the Notions, and unveil'd the Symbols) has brought to light the deeper [or more recondite] Senſe to thoſe, who, from a ſmall hint, are capable of tracing obſcure Truths by the Light of thoſe that are manifeſt. After the <hi>Preſident</hi> ſeems to have made a ſufficient Diſcourſe, ſo as that his <hi>Applications</hi> ſucceſsfully hit what he aim'd at, and the <hi>Attention</hi> of the Auditours perceive his meaning, they all give an <hi>Humm,</hi> thereby ſignifying that they are pleaſed, and chooſe, for the future, to put his Advice in Execution.</p>
                  <p>After this, he riſes up, and ſings an <hi>Hymn</hi> in Praiſe of God, which is either of his own, or ſome ancient Poets compoſure; for their Poets have left them Meaſures and Songs of all ſorts; <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>MARK</hi> (the Evangelift) going into <hi>Egypt,</hi> is reported to have been the firſt Publiſher there of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> he had written, and to have ſettled <hi>Churches</hi> in the very City of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And furthermore, that ſo great a Multitude both of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who there embraced the Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> profeſſed from the very beginning ſo ſevere and ſo Philoſophical a <hi>Courſe of Live,</hi> that <hi>Philo</hi> vouchſafed in his Writings to relate their <hi>Converſe,</hi> their <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> their <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> together, and their whole <hi>manner of Living.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:192035:40"/>
                  <p> It is reported that this <hi>Philo,</hi> in the times of <hi>Claudius,</hi> came to be familiarly acquainted with <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> who then Preached the Word of God there: neither is this unlikely. For that Work of his, of which we ſpeak, being by him elaborated a long time after, does manifeſtly contain all the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Rules</hi> which are to this preſent obſerved among us. And ſeeing he deſcribes evidently the <hi>Lives</hi> of the <hi>Aſcetae</hi> amongſt us, he does make it ſufficiently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous that he did not only ſee, but alſo very much approve of and admire the Apoſtolical Men of his time, who being, as it is probable, originally <hi>Jews,</hi> upon that account did then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, in a great meaſure, the <hi>Judaical</hi> Rites and Cuſtoms.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all therefore, in that Book which he intituled, <hi>Of Contemplative Life;</hi> or, <hi>Of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants,</hi> having profeſſed that he would inſert nothing diſagreeable to Truth, or of his own Head into that Account which he was about to give, he ſays, That the Men were called <hi>Thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peutae,</hi> and the Women that were converſant among them <hi>Therapeutriae:</hi> And he adjoyns the reaſon of that Appellation, either becauſe, like <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> they healed the Minds of thoſe that reſorted to them, curing them of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Affections; or becauſe they worſhipped the <hi>Deity</hi> with a pure and ſincere Service and Adoration.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:192035:40"/>
                  <p> Further, whether <hi>Philo</hi> himſelf gave them this Name, deviſing an Appellation agreeable to the Manners and Diſpoſitions of Men; or whether they were really ſo called from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the Name of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> not being every where ſpread and diffuſed, it is not neceſſary poſitively to affirm or contend about it. But he atteſts that, in the firſt place, they part with their Goods, ſaying, <q>That as ſoon as they betake themſelves to this courſe of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizing, they put over their Wealth and Poſſeſſions to their Relations. Then, caſting away all Care of Wordly matters, they leave the Cities, and make their Abode in Gardens and ſolitary Places; well knowing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with Men of a different and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſwaſion to be unprofitable and hurtful.</q> Which thing the Chriſtians of that time ſeem to me to have inſtituted out of a generous and moſt fervent Ardour of Faith, endeavouring to emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Prophetical ſevere Courſe of Life. Therefore in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles (which contain nothing but the perfect Truth) it is ſhewed, That all the Diſciples of the Apoſtles ſelling their Poſſeſſions and Goods, divided the Price among the Brethren, according as every one had need, that ſo there might not be any indigent Perſon amongſt them. For as the Word ſays, <hi>As many as were Poſſeſſors of Lands or Houſes ſold them, and brought the Prices of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:192035:41"/>things that were ſold and laid them down at the Apoſtles feet: and Diſtribution was made unto every Man according as he had Need.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After <hi>Philo</hi> has atteſted the very ſame things with theſe, of the <hi>Therapeutae,</hi> he adds thus much farther concerning them, word for word, ſaying, <q>This ſort of Men, indeed, is diffuſed far and wide over the whole World. For it was requiſite that both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſhould be partakers of ſo excellent a Benefit. <hi>Egypt</hi> eſpecially is full of them, throughout all its Diviſions; but moſt of all about <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi> But from all places, the principal of them retire themſelves into a moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious place above the Lake <hi>Maria,</hi> ſituate upon a little riſing Hill, excellently well ſeated both for Wholſomeneſs of Air, and Conveniency of Abiding, as into the Country of the <hi>Therapeutae.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, after he has deſcribed their <hi>Houſes,</hi> after what manner they were built, he ſpeaks thus of the <hi>Churches</hi> they have in divers Places. <q>In every Houſe there is a Chappel, called a <hi>Semnaeum,</hi> and <hi>Monaſterium,</hi> in which, alone by themſelves, they perform the Myſteries of an <hi>Holy Life.</hi> They bring in thither neither Meat nor Drink, nor any Corporal Proviſions or Neceſſaries; but only the Law, and the divine Oracles of the Prophets, and Hymns, and ſuch like; whereby Knowledge and Piety are increaſed and perfected.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:192035:41"/>
                  <p> And a little while after, he ſays: <q>All the interval of time, from Sun riſing to the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ſpend in <hi>Meditations of Philoſophy:</hi> For reading the Holy Scriptures, they Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophize after their Countrey way, and expound Allegorically. For they ſuppoſe that the Words are only Notes and Marks of ſome things of a Myſtical Nature, which are to be explained Figuratively. They have <hi>Writings</hi> of ſome ancient Perſons, who have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore famous Leaders of their Sect, and have left them many Monuments of that Learning, which conſiſts in dark and ſecret Expreſſions, which they, uſing as original Platforms, do imitate thereby that Courſe of Study.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, certainly, ſeem to be the Words of ſuch a Man as had heard ſome of our Religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the Holy Scriptures. And it is very likely that the Writings of thoſe ancient Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which he ſays they had, were the Goſpels and Writings of the Apoſtles, and certain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the ancient Prophets, of which ſort many are contained both in other Epiſtles of <hi>Paul,</hi> and alſo in that written to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards <hi>Philo</hi> thus writeth concerning the <hi>New Pſalms</hi> compoſed by them. <q>They do not only ſpend their time in Contemplation, but they compoſe Songs and Hymns to the Praiſe of God of all ſorts of Meeter and Muſical Verſe, which they write in grave and ſeemly Rhymes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:192035:42"/>
                  <p> He relates many other things of them in that Book I mentioned: But I judged theſe fitteſt to be ſelected and pickt out, in which certain Marks of <hi>Church Diſcipline</hi> are propoſed.</p>
                  <p>But if any one ſhould think what <hi>Philo</hi> here ſays to be in no wiſe proper to the Evangelical Politie, but may be adapted to others beſides thoſe I have mentioned; he will certainly be convinced by <hi>Philo</hi>'s following Words; in which, if he ſhall duly weigh the Matter, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a moſt undoubted Teſtimony of this thing. Now he writes thus: <q>Having firſt laid Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, as a certain foundation, they build thereupon the other Virtues. For none of them takes either Meat or Drink before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet: for they hold it requiſite to ſpend the Day in the Study of Philoſophy, and the Night in making neceſſary Proviſion for the Body. Therefore they allot the whole Day to ſtudy, but allow a very ſmall portion of the Night for Bodily Proviſion. Some of them forget to eat for Three Days together, ſo great is the deſire of Knowledge that poſſeſſes them. But ſome others of them are ſo well pleaſed with, and feed ſo richly and deliciouſly upon the Banquets of Wiſdom, which ſets before them wholſome Precepts, as a moſt ſumptuous Feaſt, that they are wont ſcarce to taſt any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Food in twice that ſpace, <hi>to wit,</hi> in Six Days time.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:192035:42"/>
                  <p> We ſuppoſe theſe Words of <hi>Philo</hi> to be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and without all doubt, ſpoken concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe of our Religion. But if, after all this, any one ſhall ſtill perſiſt in a peremptory denyal of theſe things; he will, at length, recede from his obſtinate difficulty of Belief, being perſwaded to ſubmit to ſuch manifeſt Demonſtrations as are no where to be found but in the Chriſtian Religion, compoſed according to the Rule of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philo</hi> ſays further therefore, <q>That among theſe Men, <hi>of whom we ſpeak,</hi> there are certain Women converſant, many of which continue Virgins being old; not out of Neceſſity, like ſome of thoſe amongſt the <hi>Grecian</hi> Prieſts, but voluntarily preſerving their Chaſtity out of an ardent Affection to and Deſire of Wiſdom; in the Embraces and Familiarity whereof they earneſtly affect to ſpend their Lives; having deſpiſed all Bodily Pleaſures, and deſiring ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly not a Mortal Iſſue, but an Immortal; which that Mind only that loves, and is beloved of God, can of it ſelf bring forth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After many other Expreſſions, he ſpeaks yet more plainly thus; <q>Their Expoſitions of <hi>Holy Writ</hi> are figurative, by way of Allegories. For theſe Men ſuppoſe the whole Law to be like a Living Creature; the bare Words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are, as it were the Body, and the inviſible Senſe, that lies hid under the Words, reſembles
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:192035:43"/>the Soul. Which ſence this Sect have and do make it their Religion earneſtly to ſearch into and contemplate, beholding in the Words, as in a Glaſs, the admirable beauty of the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no neceſſity of adding farther here an account of their <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> of the <hi>diſtinct Apartments</hi> of their Men and Women, and of their <hi>ſeveral Studies</hi> and <hi>Holy Exerciſes,</hi> now in uſe amongſt us, more eſpecially about the Feaſt of our <hi>Lord's Paſſion,</hi> when we are wont to practiſe them in Faſtings, Watchings, and attentive Reading of Holy; Scriptures. All which the Man we have ſo often mentioned, does relate in his Writings accurately, after the ſame manner in which we only at this time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them: Eſpecially he mentions the <hi>Vigils</hi> of the great Solemnity, the <hi>Holy Exerciſes</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the <hi>Hymns</hi> we are wont to recite. And how, when one has begun to ſing a Pſalm har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly and gravely, the reſt, ſilently hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do after ſing out in <hi>Chorus,</hi> the latter parts only of the Verſes. <q>And how throughout thoſe Days, lying in Straw upon the Ground, they wholly abſtain from Wine, <hi>(as he has ſaid in theſe expreſs Words)</hi> and eat nothing that has Blood in it: <hi>Water</hi> is their only Drink, and their Food is <hi>Bread</hi> with <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Hyſſop.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:192035:43"/>
                  <p> Farther he deſcribes the Order and Degrees of their <hi>Governours, to wit,</hi> thoſe who perform the Eccleſiaſtical Offices; then the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Deacons;</hi> and, laſtly, the <hi>Epiſcopal Preſidency</hi> over all. He that deſires to know theſe things more accurately, may be therein informed from the fore-mentioned Hiſtory of <hi>Philo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is therefore apparently evident to every one, that <hi>Philo</hi> writing thus, did mean thereby thoſe firſt Preachers of the <hi>Evangelical Doctrin</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> at the beginning delivered by the Apoſtles.</p>

                     <hi>HAving ſpoken of the Glory of the</hi> Chriſtian Religion, <hi>by reaſon of the Virtue of its Profeſſors, and of the Confeſſors then living, and of the Famous Biſhop</hi> Spiridion, <hi>he adds:</hi> But
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:192035:46"/>moſt of all did they illuſtrate the Church with their Virtues, and propagated the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrin, who exerciſed the Monaſtick Diſcipline. For this kind of PHILO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOPHY coming from God, with the greateſt Benefit to Men, deſpiſeth indeed many <hi>Sciences,</hi> and the Artifice of Logick as a matter of Curioſity, and by which the Exerciſe of better things is ſupplanted; nor is any thing of Advantage for a right kind of Life conferred by it; and with a more <hi>natural Prudence,</hi> void of Curioſity, teacheth thoſe things which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move wholly Vitiouſneſs, and effect better things; but the Middle things between Vertue and Vice it reputes not among the Good; but delights in only Good things, and holds him for <hi>an ill Man,</hi> who, although he abſtains from Evil, yet doth no Good. For it doth not make ſhew, but exerciſeth Vertue, and makes no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Glory,</hi> which is of Men, reſiſting the Affections of the Mind with great Fortitude; nor doth it yield to the Neceſſities of Nature, nor ſtoop to the Infirmities of the Body; but having obtain'd the Powers of a Divine Mind, it looks perpetually at the Creator of all, whom it worſhippeth Day and Night, and appeaſeth with Prayers and Supplications: But having begun a pure Religion, with Purity of Mind, and the Exerciſe of Good Deeds, it makes light of Waſhings, and ſuch like [Purifications.] For
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:192035:46"/>it judgeth Sins only to be Impurities, and being Conquerour of thoſe things which happen from without, and, as I may ſo ſay, Miſtreſs of all, is not diverted from her purpoſe, neither by the Confuſion of thoſe things which fill the Lives of Mortals, nor by any Neceſſity; neither is it provoked with Contumelies; nor being inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, doth it revenge it ſelf; nor doth it ſink, being preſſed either with Sickneſs, or with Penury of Neceſſaries; but doth rather triumph over thoſe, in which ſhe exerciſeth Patience, and Meekneſs, and Contentation of Mind all the Life long; and, as far as is poſſible to Humane Nature, becomes near to God; uſing this preſent Life as in a Paſſage, is neither anxious for the acqueſt of Earthly things, nor doth ſo much as think of things preſent, even in urging Neceſſity; but perpetually prizing a Life frugal, and diſcharged of temporal Furniture, reſpects the Felicity which it hath from thence, and is always diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for a Bleſſed End: But inceſſantly breathing out Piety towards God; it abhors the Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of filthy Speaking, not ſo much as enduring in Speech thoſe things which in Fact it hath baniſhed from its Courſe of Life, and by degrees contracting the Neceſſities of Nature, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the Body to be content with mean things; it doth with Temperance, overcome Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; Injuſtice, with Juſtice; and corrects Lying, with Truth; and in right order keeps
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:192035:47"/>Moderation in all things, and orders its Method of Life in keeping Concord and Communion with Neighbours: It provides for Friends and Strangers, communicates its Good to thoſe who want, confers upon every one what are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for them; not being troubleſome to thoſe who rejoyce, but adminiſtring Comfort to thoſe who are ſad: But in all ſtudiouſly reaching after the <hi>True Good,</hi> diſcourſing with ſound Speeches, and wiſe Thoughts void of Elegance and Rudeneſs, as with certain Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, doth cure its Auditors with Decency and Reſpect, without Contention, Scorn, or Anger: For ſince it is furniſhed with reaſon, it refuſeth every unreaſonable Motion, and compleatly rules the Affections both of the Body, and the Mind.</p>
                  <p>This moſt Excellent <hi>Philoſophy</hi> was <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,</hi> as ſome ſay, by <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; but <hi>PHILO,</hi> the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean,</hi> writes, <q>That the moſt Excellent of (his Nation) the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> being aſſembled from all Parts in a certain place at the Lake <hi>Maria,</hi> did Philoſophize in a little Hill thereunto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent: but deſcribes their <hi>Habitation, Living,</hi> and <hi>Converſation;</hi> ſuch as we alſo now ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Monks now living in <hi>Egypt.</hi> For he writes, that they who began to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophize forſook their Eſtates, and renounced both Things and Perſons belonging to them
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:192035:47"/>and lived without the Walls in ſolitary Fields and Orchards; then that their Houſes were Sacred, which they called <hi>Monaſteries;</hi> that they did devoutly worſhip God with Pſalms and Hymns, nor did touch any Food till Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet; that ſome among them abſtained for three days together or more, and lay certain days upon the Ground; but Wine, and Things that have Blood, they never at all uſed; but their Meat was Bread, and Salt, and Hyſſop, and their Drink Water: That ancient Women and Virgins dwelt among them, and for the Love of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> (or <hi>Wiſdom</hi>) of their own choice abſtained from Marriage.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Philo</hi> writing to this purpoſe ſeems to intend the <hi>Jews,</hi> who, in his time, imbracing <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> lived a little too much after the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Manner, and obſerved the Rites of their Nation. For among no others is that kind of Life to be found: from whence I conjecture, that this Philoſophy hath, from that time, flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in <hi>Egypt:</hi> But others think that the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions</hi> of thoſe times gave Occaſion to this Religion; For, becauſe thoſe who eſcaped by Flight lived in Mountains, and Deſarts, and Woods, they contracted a Habit of this kind of Living.</p>

                  <p>THERE are in <hi>Egypt Three ſorts of Monks,</hi> whereof Two are excellent, but the Third tepid and ſloathful, and by all means to be avoided. The firſt is of the <hi>Coenobites,</hi> who living together in a Religious Society, are governed by the Judgment (and Order) of One Elder, (or Superior) of which ſort a very great number of <hi>Monks</hi> are reſident throughout
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:192035:49"/>all <hi>Egypt.</hi> The ſecond, is of the <hi>Anchoretes,</hi> (or <hi>Hermites</hi>) who being firſt inſtructed in the Monaſteries, and become already perfect in their Converſation, have choſen the Secrets of the Deſart: of whoſe Perfection we alſo wiſh to be Partakers. The third, the reprehenſible one of the <hi>Sarabaits.</hi> Of all which we ſhall diſcourſe ſeverally more fully in order.</p>
                  <p>The Diſcipline of the <hi>Coenobites</hi> took its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the time of the Preaching of the Apoſtles. For ſuch was that whole Multitude of Believers at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which, in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, is thus deſcrib'd:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Multitude of them, who believed, were of one Heart, and of one Soul; neither ſaid any of them that ought of the things, which he poſſeſſed, were his own; but they had all things Common. Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were Poſſeſſors of Land or Houſes, ſold them, and brought the Prices of the things which were ſold, and laid them down at the Feet of the Apoſtles; and Diſtribution was made unto every Man according as he had need.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such, I ſay, was then the whole Church, as it is now difficult to find a very few in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries. But when, after the Apoſtles deceaſe, the Multitude of the Believers began to grow Tepid, and that moſt of all, which came into the Faith of Chriſt of Foreigners and divers Nations, of whom the Apoſtles, according to their Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:192035:49"/>of Faith, and inveterate Cuſtom of <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſm,</hi> did require no more, but that they ſhould abſtain from Fornication, and from things ſtrangled, and from Blood; and that Liberty which was indulged to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by reaſon of the Infirmity of their firſt Belief, began by degrees to contaminate the Perfection even of that Church, which was ſettled at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and the Number daily increaſing, either of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, or of Foreigners, the Fervour of that firſt Faith began to cool; not only thoſe who came flowing in to the Faith of Chriſt, but even they who were the Principal of the Church were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed from that Strictneſs. For ſome thinking that, which they ſaw conceded to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by reaſon of their Infirmity, to be lawful alſo for themſelves, believed they ſhould ſuffer no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, if they did, with their Goods and Eſtates, (retaining them in Propriety to themſelves) follow the Faith and Confeſſion of Chriſt. But others, in whom the Apoſtolick Fervour did ſtill abide, mindful of that ancient Perfection, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from their Cities, and from the Company of thoſe who believed the Negligence of a more remiſs Life to be Lawful for themſelves, or for the Church of God, began to reſide in places, without the Cities, and more ſecret, (or retir'd) and to exerciſe privately and apart the things which they remembred to be inſtituted by the Apoſtles generally throughout the whole Body
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:192035:50"/>of the Church: And ſo did that Diſcipline, which we have mentioned, of the Diſciples, who ſequeſtred themſelves from the Contagion of the reſt, come to a Settlement. Who, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, by degrees, being ſeparate from the Crowds of Believers, becauſe they did abſtain from Marriage, and withdrew themſelves from the Company of their Parents, and the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the World, were called <hi>Monachi,</hi> or <hi>Monazontes,</hi> for the Strictneſs of their ſingle and ſolitary Life. Whence it follow'd, that, from the Communion of their Company, they were called <hi>Coenobitae,</hi> and their Cells and Habitations <hi>Coenobia.</hi> This therefore alone was the moſt Ancient kind of <hi>Monks,</hi> which was the prime, not only in Time, but alſo in Grace (and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,) and which continued inviolable for very many Years, even to the Age of Father <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Antony;</hi> the Footſteps whereof we even now ſee remaining in the ſtrict <hi>Coenobia,</hi> (or Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as now called.)</p>
                  <p>Of this number of Perfect ones, and, as I may ſay, fertile Root, were produced after theſe alſo the Flowers and Fruits of the <hi>Holy Anchoretes,</hi> (or <hi>Hermites;</hi>) of which Profeſſion, we know, thoſe, whom we a little before remembred, <hi>viz.</hi> Holy <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Antony,</hi> to have been the Principal, or firſt Beginners. Who betook themſelves to the Secrets or Retirements of Solitude, not as ſome, through Puſillanimity, or the Diſeaſe of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:192035:50"/>Impatience, but out of Deſign of more ſublime Advancement, and Divine Contemplation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the former of them is ſaid to have gone into the Wilderneſs under pretence of Neceſſity, while, in the time of Perſecution, he avoids the Snares of his Relations. Thus from that Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which we have mentioned, proceeded ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Perfection, the Followers of which are deſervedly named <hi>Anachoretae,</hi> that is, Retir'd, becauſe not content with this Victory, whereby they have avoided the ſecret Snares of the Devil among Men, deſigning to encounter the Devils in an open Combat and manifeſt Conflict, they fear not to enter into the vaſt Receſſes of the Wilderneſs, in imitation of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who remained in the Wilderneſs his whole Life; and of <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and of thoſe whom the Apoſtle makes mention of thus: <hi>They wandred about in Sheep-skins, and Goat-skins, being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, afflicted, tormented: Of whom the World was not worthy, wandering in Deſarts, and in Mountains, and in Dens, and in Caves of the Earth,</hi> Heb. 11.37, 38.</p>
                  <p>And when the Chriſtian Religion did flouriſh in theſe two Profeſſions of Monks, but this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alſo began to decline, there aroſe up after thoſe, that worſt and unfaithful kind of Monks, or rather, that Evil Plantation reviving grew up, which, by <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> ſprouting out in the beginning of the Church, was cut down by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:192035:51"/>the Apoſtle <hi>Peter;</hi> which, among the Monks, was judged deteſtable and execrable, nor by any other more uſed, ſo long as the Fear of that ſtrict Sentence remained with them fixed in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Faithful, with which the Bleſſed Apoſtle not ſuffering the afore-ſaid Leaders of that New Crime to be cured with any Penitence, or any Satisfaction, did cut off the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sprout with ſudden Death. But that Example, whereby with Apoſtolical Severity it was puniſhed in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> being, through long Inconſiderateneſs, and the obliter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature of Time, by degrees, ſubſtracted from the Contemplation of ſome, there aroſe that ſort of the <hi>Sarabites;</hi> who from thence that they did ſequeſter themſelves from the Congregation of the <hi>Coenobites,</hi> and did ſeparately provide for their own Occaſions, in the propriety of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Language were named <hi>Sarabites,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding out of the Number of thoſe, whom we mentioned before, who chooſe rather to ſimulate the Evangelical Perfection, than to embrace it in Truth and Reality; being provok'd with an Emulation, or by the Commendation of thoſe, who preferred the compleat Nudity of Chriſt before all the Riches of the World. For theſe, while either with a weak Mind they affect a Matter of the higheſt Virtue, or are by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity compelled to come to this Proſeſſion, while they are eager only to be reckoned under
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:192035:51"/>the Name of <hi>Monks,</hi> without any Emulation of their Studies or Endeavours, they do not at all ſeek after the Diſcipline of the <hi>Coenobites,</hi> nor are they ſubject to the Will and Ordering of the Seniors or Superiors, nor being inſtructed by their Traditions, do they learn to overcome their own Wills, or receive any Rule of Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a regular Erudition, but renouncing (the World) in outward Appearance, <hi>that is,</hi> to the ſight of Men, they either continue in their Houſes under the Priviledge of this Name, obliged to the ſame Occupations; or building Cells for themſelves, and calling them <hi>Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> they abide there in their own Power and Liberty, not at all ſubmitting to the Evangelical Precepts, <hi>viz.</hi> that they be imployed in no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude for daily Food, in no Diſtractions of Family Concerns; which they only uſe without Infidel doubting, who being ſet free from all the Goods of this World, do ſo ſubject themſelves to the Preſidents of the Monaſteries, that they do not ſo much as own themſelves to be Lords of themſelves. But they, who declining, as we ſaid, the Strictneſs of the Monaſtery, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide two or three together in Cells, not content to be govern'd by the Care and Government of the Abbot, but principally procuring this for themſelves, that being ſet free from the Yoke of the Superiors, they may have the Liberty of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing their own Wills, and of going out, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:192035:52"/>gading where, or doing what they pleaſe, even more in their daily Works than thoſe, who live in the Monaſteries, are (indeed) conſumed (and waſted) Day and Night, but not with the ſame Faith, and the ſame Purpoſe (of Mind.) For this they do, not that they may ſubject (or commit) the Fruit or Product of their Labour to the Judgment of the Steward; but that they may acquire Money, which they may lay up. Between which, what <hi>Difference</hi> there is, I pray you obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe not thinking any thing of the Morrow, do offer to God the moſt grateful Fruits of their Labour. But theſe extending their Infidel So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude not only to the Morrow, but even to the Terms of many Years, believe God either a Lyar, or a Beggar, who either cannot, or will not, afford them his promiſed Sufficiency of daily Food and Rayment. Thoſe, with all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, deſire that they may attain Nudity of all things, and Poverty: Theſe, that they may obtain an Affluence of all Goods: They ſtriving with one another, labour to exceed in their daily Works the ſtated Rule, for this purpoſe, that what is redundant above the Holy Uſes of the Monaſtery, may be given to the Priſons, or to the Hoſpitals, or to the Poor, at the Pleaſure of the Abbot: Theſe, that what remains of their daily Gluttony, may ſerve either for a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Gratification, or be hoarded up through the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:192035:52"/>Sin of Covetouſneſs. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To grant that theſe things, which are with none of the beſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes hoarded up, may alſo, by them, be better diſpoſed of than we have ſaid; yet even ſo do they not aſpire to the Worth of the Virtue and Perfection of the others. For they bringing ſo great Revenues to the Monaſtery, and daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing them themſelves, do perſevere in ſo great Humility of Subjection, that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Power, as of themſelves, ſo alſo of thoſe things which, with their Sweat, they have acquired, continually renewing the Fervor of their firſt Ab-renunciation, while they do daily ſtrip themſelves of the Fruits of their own La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. But theſe, even in that which they give to the Poor, being puff'd up, do daily fall head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. Thoſe, the Patience and Strictneſs, with which they ſo devoutly hold out in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which they had once imbraced, that they never fulfill their own Wills, makes them daily crucified to the World, and living Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: but theſe, the Tepidity and Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own Wills ſinks down alive into Hell.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo another, <hi>a fourth ſort,</hi> which we ſee lately to have riſen in theſe, who flatter themſelves with the Shew and Image of <hi>Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retes,</hi> and who, in their Beginnings, did ſeem with a kind of ſhort Fervour to deſire the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the <hi>Coenobites,</hi> but preſently being
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:192035:53"/>cool'd, while they refuſe to cut off their former Manners and Vices, nor are content long to bear the Yoak of Humility and Patience, and diſdain to be ſubject to the Government of the Seniors, or Superiors, they require ſeparate Cells, and deſire to ſit Solitaries, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſo, they being provoked by none, they may be thought Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, Meek, and Humble, by Men. Which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, yea, Lukewarmneſs, whom it once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, it never permits to arrive at Perfection. For, by this means, their Corruptions are not only not cured, but ſtrengthened for the worſe, while they are provok'd by none; as a certain deadly inteſtine Poyſon, by how much the more it is conceiled, ſpreading ſo much the deeper, makes the Diſeaſe incurable to the Party.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:192035:53"/>Deſarts, and from thence that they have retired far from Men, are ſo called. The third, that which they call <hi>Remoboth,</hi> a very bad and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteemed kind, and that which, in our Province, is either ſole, or the firſt. Theſe inhabit two or three, and not many more, together, living at their own Pleaſure and Command, and of what they have wrought, bring all together for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Maintenance. They dwell, for the moſt part, in Cities and Towns, and, as if their Art, not their Lives, were Holy, what-ever they ſell is at a greater Price (than ordinary.) There are often Squabbles among them, becauſe living of their own Proviſions they do not ſuffer themſelves to be ſubject to any one. They are wont, in truth, to contend about Faſtings; and what is matter of Secreſie, they make it matter of Victory (or Triumph.) Among them all things are affected, their Sleeves large, their San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals flopping, their Garment thicker, and frequent are their Sighs, viſits of Virgins, and detraction of the Clergy; and if a Feaſt-Day come, they fill themſelves till they vomit.

They abide ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, but in Cells joyned together, until the ninth hour; according to their Inſtitute, none goes to another, except theſe Decanes or Deans, whom we mentioned, that if, perhaps, any of them hath any doubtful Thoughts, he may be comforted by his Diſcourſes. After the ninth hour they come together in common, where Pſalms are ſung or chanted, the Scriptures read, as accuſtomed, and the Prayers being done, and all ſitting down, he in the middle, whom they call the Father, begins to diſcourſe; while he is ſpeaking, there is great Silence, (and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs) that no one dares to look aſide, or to hawk and ſpit. The Excellence of the Speaker appears in the Weeping of the Auditors: ſilent Tears trickle down their Faces, but their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction doth not ſo much as break out into Sighs. But when he comes to ſpeak concerning <hi>the Kingdom of Christ, and of the future Beatitude and Glory to come,</hi> you may ſee all, with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Sigh, and Eyes lift up to Heaven, ſay, <hi>Who will give me the Wings of a Dove, and I will fly away, and be at reſt?</hi> After this the Aſſembly is diſmiſſed, and each Tithing or Decennary, with their Father, go to their Table, where they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:192035:54"/>ſerve every Week by turn. There is no Noiſe at their Meal, none, while eating, ſpeaks: They live upon Bread, Pulſe, and Herbs, which are ſeaſoned only with Salt. Wine only Old Men take, who with Children have their Meal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that the ſpent Age of ſome may be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteined, and the tender Age of others not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. Then they riſe together, and having ſung an Hymn, retire to their Stalls. There, until Evening, each with his Companions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed to this purpoſe: Did you ſee ſuch an one, and ſuch an one? What Grace in him? What Silence? What decent Comportment? If they ſee one weak, they comfort him; if fervent in the Love of God, they incourage him to Induſtry. And becauſe in the Night, out of the time of publick Prayers, each doth watch in his own Couch, they go about to every one of their Cells, and laying their Ear to them, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently liſten what they do. Whom they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend more remiſs, they do not preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; but, diſſemble what they hear, viſit him more often; and Beginners they rather provoke at firſt, than compel to Prayer. The Work of the Day is ſettled, and being delivered to the Decane or Tithing-Man, is after carried to the Steward, who himſelf alſo doth every Month, with great Reverence, give account to the (General) Father of all. By whom alſo the Proviſions, when made ready, are taſted;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:192035:55"/>and becauſe none may ſay I want a Coat, or a Caſſock, or a Mat, he ſo orders all things, that none ſhould ask, none ſhould want. But if any begin to be Sick, he is carried to a larger Room, and is ſo taken Care of by the Miniſtery of the Old Men, that he deſireth not the Delicacies of Cities, or the Affection of his Mother. Upon the <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> they apply themſelves only to Prayer and Reading; which indeed they do at all times when their Work is done: They do every Day learn ſomething out of the Scriptures. Their <hi>Faſt</hi> is alike all the Year, except <hi>Lent,</hi> in which only it is permitted them to live more ſtrictly. From <hi>Eaſter</hi> to <hi>Whitſontide</hi> their Suppers are changed into Dinners, whereby both the Eccleſiaſtical Tradition is obſerved, and they do not charge their Stomach with a doubled Portion of Food. Such doth <hi>Philo,</hi> an Imitator of the <hi>Platonick</hi> Stile; ſuch <hi>Joſephus,</hi> the <hi>Greek Livie,</hi> in the ſecond Hiſtory of the <hi>Captivity of the Jews,</hi> relate the ESSEANS to be.</p>

                  <p> Who knows not that a Multitude of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, of moſt exquiſite Continence, are daily more and more diffuſed throughout the whole World, and eſpecially in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which you can by no means be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of. I'll ſay nothing of thoſe, whom I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned a little before, who being moſt retired wholly from all ſight of Men, are content with Bread alone, which at certain times is brought to them, and Water, inhabit the moſt barren Deſarts, enjoying Communication with God, to whom they adhere with pure Minds, and are bleſſed with the Contemplation of his Beauty, which cannot be perceived but by the Intellects of Saints. I ſay I will ſay nothing of theſe: for they ſeem to ſome to have forſaken Humane Affairs more than they ought, who underſtand not how much their Minds do profit in Prayer, and their Lives for Examples to others, whoſe Bodies we are not permitted to ſee. But I think it long and ſuperfluous to diſcourſe of this: For this ſo great a height of Sanctity, who doth not of his own accord think it to be admir'd and honoured, who by our Speech can think ſo? Only they are to be admoniſhed, who vainly boaſt themſelves, that the Temperance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence of the moſt Holy Chriſtians of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith hath proceeded ſo far, that it may ſeem to ſome that it ſhould be reſtrained and recalled within Humane Bounds: So far above
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:192035:56"/>Men are their Minds thought to have aſcended by thoſe who are diſpleaſed at it.</p>
                  <p>But if this exceeds our Ability to bear, who will not admire and applaud thoſe, who, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and forſaken the Allurements of this World, are congregated into a common, moſt chaſt and moſt holy Life, ſpend their Days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, living in Prayers, Leſſons, Conferences, not puffed up with any Pride, nor troubleſome with any Obſtinacy, nor pining with any Envy; but modeſt, baſhful, quiet, do offer up to God their Lives moſt agreeable among themſelves, and moſt firmly adhering to Him, from whom they received this Power, a moſt grateful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. None poſſeſſes any thing of his own; None is burthenſome to any one. They work thoſe things with their Hands, with which their Body may be ſupplied, and they not be hindered from God. But the Work it ſelf they deliver to thoſe whom they call <hi>Deans,</hi> becauſe they have the Over-ſight of Tens, that none of them may be touch'd with any Care of their Body, neither in Food or Rayment, nor any thing elſe needful for daily Occaſions, or for any change of Health, if it happen, as is common. But thoſe Deans diſpenſing all things with great Care, and making ready what-ever that Life doth, by reaſon of the Imbecility of the Body, require, do yet deliver all over to one, whom they call <hi>the Father.</hi> But theſe Fathers are not only moſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:192035:57"/>holy in their Manners, but moſt excellent in Divine Doctrin, eminent in all things: They direct without any Pride thoſe, whom they call Sons, with great Authority of Command, and with great Readineſs of Obedience in them. They meet all at the end of the Day every one out of their Cells, while yet Faſting, to hear that Father. And they meet before each of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, at leaſt <hi>Three Thouſand Men:</hi> for many more live under one. They <hi>hear</hi> with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Attention, and deepeſt Silence, ſignifying the Affections of their Mind, as the Speech of him who ſpeaks moveth them, either with Sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or with Weeping; but Modeſt, and without Noiſe. Then they refreſh their Bodies ſo much as is ſufficient for Health and Salubrity, each reſtraining his Appetite, leſt it be greedy even of thoſe few and mean things which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. In like manner they abſtain, not only from Fleſh and Wine, for ſufficient allay of Luſts, but alſo from thoſe things which do ſo much the more excite and provoke the Appetite of the Stomach and of the Palate, by how much they may ſeem to ſome more clean: Under which pretence, a filthy Deſire of exquiſite Diſhes, without Fleſh, is wont to be ridiculouſly and filthily defended. Truly, what-ever is redundant above neceſſary Proviſion; for there is much redundant by the Work of their Hands, and the Strictneſs of their Meals; it is with no
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:192035:57"/>leſs Care diſtributed to the Poor, than with what it was earned by them who diſtribute it. For they do by no means endeavour that theſe things ſhould abound with them, but by all means are diligent, that what doth abound may not remain with them; inſomuch, that they ſend even Ships laden to thoſe places where indigent People dwell. There's no need to ſay more of a thing ſo well known.</p>
                  <p>This is alſo <hi>the Life of the</hi> WOMEN, who ſerve God with Carefulneſs and Chaſtity, who are ſeparated and removed from Men as far as is decent, joyned to them only in pious Charity, and Imitation of Virtue; to whom Young Men have no acceſs at all, nor the Ancient neither, although moſt Grave and Approved, further than to the threſhold, for the ſupplying them with the Neceſſaries which they need.

                  <p>SON, thou knoweſt after how many Days waiting before the Doors, thou art this Day received. Of which difficulty (of thy Reception) thou oughteſt, in the firſt place, to underſtand the Cauſe: for it may advantage thee much in this Life, which thou deſireſt to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:192035:59"/>enter into, if, underſtanding the Reaſon of it, thou doſt accordingly come to the Service of Chriſt, and as thou oughteſt to do. For as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Glory is promiſed hereafter to thoſe, who faithfully ſerve God, and do adhere to Him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Inſtitution of this Rule: ſo moſt grievous Pains are prepared for them, who ſhall perform the ſame coldly and negligently; and ſhall neglect to produce congruous Fruits of Sanctity, according to what they do profeſs, or by Men are believed to be. For it is better not to Vow, than to vow, and not perform: and <hi>Curſed is he who doth the Work of the Lord ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligently.</hi> Therefore, for this cauſe, waſt thou long refuſed by us, not that we do not deſire, with all our Hearts, to promote the Salvation of thee, or of all, [or do not wiſh, even afar off, to meet thoſe who deſire to come to Chriſt] but leſt, being too haſtily received, we ſhould make both our ſelves guilty before God of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and thee of the greater Puniſhment, if, at preſent, eaſily received, and, not underſtanding the weight of this Profeſſion, thou ſhouldeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward prove either a (total) Deſerter, or a tepid (Profeſſor.)— Know therefore that this Day thou art dead to this World, and that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle, <hi>thou art crucified to the World, and the World to thee.</hi>— But perhaps thou wilt ſay, How can one that is Living be Crucified? Hear briefly the Reaſon.</p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:192035:59"/>
                  <p> Our <hi>Croſs,</hi> is <hi>the Fear of the Lord:</hi> for as one Crucified, hath not the power thereafter to move or turn his Members any way at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his own Mind; ſo we alſo ought to apply our Wills and Deſires, not to that which pleaſeth us at preſent, but according to the Precept of the Lord, as it obligeth us. And as he who is fixed to the Tree of the Croſs, doth not then regard the things of this World, nor think of his Affections, is then moved with no deſire of Poſſeſſions, and while he is yet living in the Body, reckons himſelf dead to all Earthly things; ſo we alſo, by the Fear of God, ought to be crucified to all carnal Vices, and there always to have the Eyes of our Minds fixed, whether we ought every moment to hope to arrive. We muſt therefore beware that we do not at any time reſume any of thoſe things, which, at our Renouncing (the World) we have forſaken. For the crafty Serpent doth always watch our Steps, <hi>that is,</hi> he lays Snares for our going out, and even to the end of our Life doth always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſupplant us: and therefore to have begun well profits nothing, if it be not well finiſhed. Wherefore, according to the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Scripture, being entred into the Service of the Lord, ſtand in the Fear of the Lord, and prepare thy Soul, not for Eaſe, not for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, but for Temptations and Streights: for we muſt through many Tribulations enter into
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:192035:60"/>the Kingdom of God; <hi>For narrow is the Gate, and ſtraight is the Way, which leads to Life, and few there are who find it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Beginning therefore of our <hi>Salvation,</hi> is <hi>the Fear of the Lord:</hi> For by this, is both the beginning of our Converſion, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our Virtue obtained; which, when it has once pierced into the Mind of Man, it produceth a Contempt of all (theſe) things, and begets an abhorrence of the World; and by Contempt, and forſaking of our Riches, is <hi>true Humility</hi> obtained. And Humility is proved by theſe Tokens: 1. If the Religious perſon have in him all his Wills mortified. 2. If he conceil not his Acts nor his Thoughts from his Superior. 3. If he commit all to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (and reſerve) nothing to his own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. 4. If in all things commanded he keep the Meekneſs of Obedience, and Conſtancy of Patience. 5. If he do Injury to none, and alſo bear patiently thoſe done to him. 6. If he do nothing beſides the Exemplar of his Rule. 7. If to all things commanded him, he judgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as an ill and unworthy Workman. 8. If he declare himſelf inferior to all. 9. If he hold his Tongue, and be not forward to ſpeak. 10. If he be not apt to Laughter. By ſuch Tokens is true Humility diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>And theſe things alſo be neceſſary for thee to be obſerved in the Congregation, <hi>viz.</hi> That,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:192035:60"/>according to the Declaration of the <hi>Pſalmist,</hi> thou beeſt as one Deaf, not Hearing; and one Dumb, not opening his Mouth: queſtioning nothing, judging nothing of theſe things, which ſhall be commanded thee. Wherefore thou oughteſt not to hope to obtain thy Patience from the Virtue of others, <hi>that is,</hi> that thou then only poſſeſs it, when thou art provoked by no Body.</p>
                  <p>The beginning of our Salvation, (as hath been ſaid) is, <hi>the Fear of our Lord.</hi> Of the Fear of our Lord, is ſound Compunction begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; From Compunction of the Heart, proceed Contempt and Nakedneſs of all Riches; From that Nakedneſs, Humility proceed; Of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is begotten Mortification of our Wills; And by Mortification of our Wills, are all Vices ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated; By the expulſion of Vices, do Virtues fructifie and grow up; And by the growth of Virtues, is Purity of Heart acquired; And by Purity of Heart, is the Perfection of Apoſtolical Charity poſſeſſed. <hi>Caſſian.</hi> 4. <hi>Inſtit. cap.</hi> 32.</p>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:192035:62"/>but from the Grace of Reformation, you muſt firſt be affected with a Deſire of that Beatitude, of which it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in Heart, for they ſhall ſee God:</hi> that ye may alſo arrive to that, concerning which the Angel ſaid to <hi>Daniel: But they, who are inſtructed, ſhall ſhine as the Splendor of the Firmament; and they, who inſtruct many to Righteouſneſs, as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, continuing that Diligence of Reading, which I perceive you have, make haſt with all Induſtry, as ſoon as may be, to learn compleatly the Actual, that is, <hi>the Moral Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline;</hi> for without this cannot be underſtood that Contemplative Purity, which I mentioned, which they alone obtain, as a Reward after the Expence of many Labours and Pains, who become perfect, not by the Words of other Teachers, but by the Virtue of their own Actions.— If ye will prepare a Sacred Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle in your Heart for Spiritual Knowledge; purge your ſelves from the Contagion of all Vices, and deveſt your ſelves of the Cares of this Life: For it is impoſſible for a Soul which is buſied but a little in Worldly Affairs, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Gift of Knowledge, or to be fruitful in Spiritual Senſes, or retentive of Sacred Leſſons. Obſerve therefore in the firſt place, leſt your Study in Reading, and Labour of your Deſire, be fruſtrated by vain Elation, that you impoſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:192035:63"/>
                     <hi>Silence</hi> on your Tongue: For this is the firſt Entrance of Actual Diſcipline;— and that you receive the Inſtitutions and Sentences of all the Seniors with Attention and Silence; and laying them up in your Heart, make haſt more to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice them your ſelves, than to teach them to others: For from this, will grow a pernicious Preſumption of Vain-Glory; but from that, the Fruit of Spiritual Underſtanding. Do not dare therefore to utter any thing in a Conference of the Seniors, but what either an hurtful Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or the Cauſe of neceſſary Knowledge doth compel, as ſome, who, fill'd with the Affection of Vain-Glory, pretend to enquire what they know very well: For it is impoſſible that he, who, out of deſign to gain the Applauſe of Men applies himſelf to the Study of Reading, ſhould obtain the Gift of <hi>true Science.</hi> For, of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he who is fettered with this Paſſion, muſt be bound alſo with other Vices, and eſpecially of <hi>Pride;</hi> and ſo failing in the Actual and Moral Undertaking, he cannot at all attain to <hi>Spiritual Knowledge,</hi> which ſprings from it. Neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to teach to any in Words, what you have not firſt practiſed in Deeds: For this Order hath our Lord, by his Example, taught us to obſerve, of whom it is ſaid, —<hi>Which Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to do, and to teach.</hi> Beware therefore, leſt leaping out to Teach, before Practice, you be reputed in the Number of them, of whom, in the

                  <p>If therefore you would attain to the true Knowledge of the Scriptures, you muſt make haſt firſt to obtain a ſettled <hi>Humility</hi> in your Heart; which will lead you, not to that which puffs up, but to that which gives Light of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or illuſtrates Knowledge by the Perfection of Charity.

                  <p>Moreover, this is by all means to be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, that having expell'd all Earthly Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Thought, you give your ſelf conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to Sacred Leſſons, until continual Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation tincture your Mind, and form it to the Likeneſs of it ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 10.)</p>
                  <p>But it is impoſſible, as I ſaid before, that any one unexperienced ſhould either underſtand or teach theſe things: For he who is not capable ſo much as to conceive them, How ſhould he be fit to teach 'em?

For, for <hi>this</hi> do we undergo and act all things: For <hi>this</hi> are <hi>Parents, Countrey, Dignities, Riches, Delights of this World,</hi> and all <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> contemned, <hi>to wit,</hi> that perpetual Purity of Heart may be retained. This Deſign therefore being reſolved upon, our Acts and Thoughts ſhall always be rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:192035:64"/>to the obtaining of it. Which if it be not continually ſet before our Eyes, it will not only make all our Labors vain and inſtable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Profit, but alſo all our Thoughts varying and contrary to themſelves. For, of neceſſity, the Soul, which hath not whether to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and where principally to reſt, muſt every moment be changed, according to the variety of its Occurrences; and by thoſe things which happen without, be continually transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that State which next preſents its ſelf.

                  <p>For this Cauſe therefore are all things to be done and ſought after by us: for <hi>this,</hi> is the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert</hi> to be choſen; for <hi>this, Faſtings, Watchings, Labors, Nakedneſs, Readings,</hi> and other Exerciſes of <hi>Virtue,</hi> we know, are by us to be undertaken; <hi>to wit,</hi> that by them we may prepare and keep our Heart unhurt from all noxious Paſſions; and by treading thoſe ſteps aſcend to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Charity. —They are not Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the Inſtruments of Perfection: for in them doth not conſiſt the End of this Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; but by them is the End arrived to. —What-ever therefore may diſturb that Purity and Tranquility of our Mind, although it may ſeem Profitable and Neceſſary, is to be avoided as noxious.

                  <p>
                     <hi>This</hi> ought therefore to be our principal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, <hi>this</hi> the unmoveable Deſign of our Heart continually to be deſired, that our Mind
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:192035:65"/>many continually adhere to God and Divine things. What-ever differs from that, how-ever great, is to be judged of an inferior Nature, or of the meaneſt, or certainly noxious. The Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of this Mind or Action is very finely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the Goſpel in the Perſons of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> —In which you ſee that our Lord placed the principal Good in the Theory, <hi>that is,</hi> in Divine Contemplation. Whence the other Virtues, though we declare them neceſſary, yet we reſolve them to be reckoned in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree; becauſe all are ſought for the ſake of this alone. For our Lord ſaying, Thou art ſolicitous, and art troubled about many things; but there is need (but) of a few, or even One; he placed the Chief Good, not in an actual, though commendable Work, and abounding in many Fruits; but in Contemplation of Himſelf; which is indeed ſimple, and (but) One, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 8.)</p>
                  <p>To attend unceſſantly to God and Divine Contemplation, is impoſſible for Man incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with this Infirmity of the Fleſh. But it behoves us to know, where we ought to have the Intention of our Mind fixed, and to which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign we may always apply the Proſpect of our Mind, which when it can obtain, it rejoyceth; and from which, being diſtracted, it grieves and ſighs; and doth ſo often feel her ſelf to have departed from her chief Good, as ſhe doth find

                  <p>THE End of every Monk, and Perfection of his Heart, tends to a continual and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted <hi>Perſeverance in Prayer,</hi> and, as far as is permitted to Humane Frailty, ſtrives after an unmoveable Tranquility, and perpetual Purity of Mind. For the Enjoyment of which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedly ſeek, and continually exerciſe as well Labour of the Body, as Contrition of Spirit: And there is between theſe a certain reciprocal and inſeparable Conjunction. For as the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:192035:67"/>of all Virtues doth tend to the Perfection of Prayer; ſo unleſs all theſe be bound and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted together by the toping of it, they can by no means hold out firm and ſtable. For as without them cannot this perpetual and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Tranquility of Prayer, of which we ſpeak, be acquired and perfected; ſo neither can thoſe Virtues, which prepare for it, without the Continuance of it, be accompliſhed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither can we rightly treat of the <hi>Effect of Prayer,</hi> or enter to the principal End of it, which is accompliſhed by the Employment of all Virtues, by a haſty Diſcourſe, unleſs firſt all theſe things, which for the obtaining of it are either to be cut off, or to be prepared, be in order enumerated and diſcuſſed; and according to the Inſtruction of the Parable in the Goſpel, thoſe things, which belong to the Building of that Spiritual and more ſublime Tower, be counted and diligently prepared for it. Which, notwithſtanding, will neither profit, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; nor rightly admit thoſe high topings of Perfection to be built upon them, unleſs firſt all refuſe of Vices being caſt out, and all dead rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh of Paſſions dug up, the moſt firm Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> be laid upon the ſound and ſolid Earth of our Heart, that Evangelical Rock, upon which this Tower to be built, with the Employments of all the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Virtues, may be both unmoveably eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:192035:67"/>and raiſed up to the higheſt Heavens by the Conſiſtence of its own Firmneſs.— (<hi>cap.</hi> 2.)</p>
                  <p>And therefore, that the Prayer be made with that Fervour and Purity it ought, theſe things are by all means to be obſerved. <hi>First,</hi> The Solicitude of Earthly things in general, is to be cut off: Next, not only the Care, but not ſo much as the Memory of any Buſineſs or Cauſe is to be admitted: Detractions, idle Talk, much Talk, Jeſtings, are likewiſe alſo to be cut off: Anger above all things, or the Perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sadneſs, are to be throughly rooted out: The pernicious Food of Carnal Concupiſcence, and the Love of Money, is to be plucked up by the Roots: and theſe and the like Vices, which are viſible even to the Eyes of Men, being cut off and wholly thruſt out, and ſuch a cleanſing of the Rubbiſh, which is perfected in the Purity of Simplicity, (or Singleneſs of Heart) and Innocence firſt made, the unſhaken Foundations of a profound Humility, which may bear a Tower reaching to the Heavens, are firſt to be laid; then is the Superſtruction of Spiritual Virtues to be built upon it: and from all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, (or Reaſoning) and light Wandering, is the Mind to be reſtrained, that ſo it may, by degrees, be elevated to God, and to Spiritual Intuition. For what-ever our Soul conceives before the <hi>Hour of Prayer,</hi> of neceſſity it will occur to us while we pray, by intruſion of our
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:192035:68"/>Remembrance. Wherefore, ſuch as we would be found while we Pray, ſuch ought we to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves to be before the time of Prayer. For from the precedent State is the Mind form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 3.)</p>
                  <p>The Quality of the Soul is not unfitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a light Feather, which, if it be not ſpoiled by ſome wet from without happening to it, by the levity of its own Subſtance, with the help of a gentle Breath, is as it were naturally raiſed up on high, and to the Heavens: But if it be aggravated with the Acceſſion of any wet, it is not only not raiſed up to any Aerial Flights by its natural Mobility, but will be depreſſed down to the very Earth by the weight of the Wet received. So alſo our Mind, if it be not aggravated with contracted Vices and Worldly Cares, or corrupted with the Humour of nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious Luſt, being lifted up, as with the natural Advantage of its Purity, will, with the leaſt Breath of Spiritual Meditation, be elevated on high; and forſaking low and Earthly things, will be tranſported to thoſe which are Heavenly and inviſible. So that we are very properly admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by our Lord's Precepts: <hi>See that your Hearts be not at any time over-charged with Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, and the Cares of the World,</hi> Luk. 21.34. And, therefore, if we would our Prayers ſhould pierce, not only the Heavens, but what are above the Heavens, let us take Care
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:192035:68"/>to raiſe our Mind purged from all Earthly Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and cleanſed from all Dregs of Paſſions to its natural Sublimity, that ſo our Prayer may aſcend to God diſ-burthened of all Weight of Corruption. (<hi>cap.</hi> 4.)</p>
                  <p>The Intention of a Monk ought always to be fixed in God; by whom even a ſmall Separation from that Chief Good is to be accounted a preſent Death, and moſt pernicious Deſtruction. And when the Mind comes to be ſettled in ſuch a Tranquility, or looſed from the tyes of all Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Paſſions, and the Intention of the Heart doth moſt tenaciouſly adhere to that One Chief Good, then doth it fulfill that of the Apoſtle; <hi>Pray without Intermiſſion,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.17. and, <hi>In every place lifting up pure Hands without Anger or Diſputings,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. For the Senſe of the Mind, if I may ſo ſay, being drench'd in this Purity, and reformed from the Earthly Filth to a Spiritual and Angelick Likeneſs, what-ever it receives into its ſelf, what-ever it handles, what-ever it doth, will be a moſt pure and ſincere Prayer. (<hi>cap.</hi> 6.)</p>
                  <p>The <hi>various Species of Prayer,</hi> I judge, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be comprehended without mighty Contrition of Heart, Purity of Mind, and Illumination of the Holy Spirit.— For according to the meaſure of Purity, in which every Soul doth proceed, and the quality of the State, in which, either by Occurrences ſhe is lowered, or by her
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:192035:69"/>own Induſtry renewed, ſhe her ſelf is every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment new formed. And therefore it is certain, that Prayers are by none always made of the ſame form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>cap.</hi> 8.)</p>
                  <p>They who having the penal thorn of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience pluck'd out of their Heart, are <hi>ſecure,</hi> ruminating the Favours and Mercies of the Lord, which he hath either in time paſt given, or at preſent doth give, or hath prepared for the future, with a moſt pure Mind, are tranſported with a moſt fervent Heart to that ardent Prayer, which cannot be expreſſed with the Tongue of Men, or comprehended. Yet ſometimes a Mind, which hath profitted to that true effect of Purity, and hath now begun to be rooted in it, is wont, conceiving all the parts of Prayer at once together, and like an incompreſſible and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Flame ſpreading over all, to pour out to God ineffable Prayers of a moſt pure vigour, which the Spirit it ſelf interceeding with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable Groans, we being ignorant, doth ſend forth to God, conceiving in that moment ſo great things, and pouring them out ineffably in Supplication, as it cannot at another time; I will not ſay, repeat with the Mouth, but not ſo much as recollect with the Mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>cap</hi> 15.)</p>
                  <p>The higher and more ſublime State (of Prayer) is formed by the Contemplation of God alone, and the Fervour of Charity, by which the Soul being caſt down, and melted into Love
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:192035:69"/>of him, doth very familiarly diſcourſe to God, as its own Father, with a peculiar Devotion. Which State that we ought diligently to deſire, the Form of the LORD's-PRAYER doth inſtruct us, ſaying;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Father.</hi> When therefore we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with our own Mouth the God and Lord of the Univerſe to be our Father, we do indeed profeſs our ſelves to be adopted to be the Sons of God out of a State of Slavery: adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>Who art in Heaven;</hi> that flying from the abode of the preſent Life, which we live upon Earth, with much horror, as a Pilgrimage, and ſeparating us far from our Father, we may haſten rather with our utmoſt deſire to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in which we confeſs our Father liveth; and may admit nothing of that kind which may render us unworthy of this our Profeſſion, and of the Nobility of ſuch an Adoption; or make us incurr his Diſpleaſure: To which Order and Degree being promoted, we ſhall continually be inflamed with that Devotion, which is in good Children, that now we ſhall imploy all our Affection, not for our Commodities, but for the Glory of our Father. Saying to Him, <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed be thy Name,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>cap.</hi> 18.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And after a brief but excellent Explication of all the parts of this Prayer, he adds:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee therefore, what Model and Form of Prayer is propoſed to us by the Judge himſelf,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:192035:70"/>who is to be intreated by it; in which is no Petition of <hi>Riches,</hi> no Remembrance of <hi>Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> no Prayer for <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Strength,</hi> no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Corperal Needs,</hi> or of <hi>Temporal Life</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. The Creator of Eternity will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fading, nothing vile, nothing temporal, to be implored of him. And therefore he will do a very great Injury to his Magnificence and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, who-ever paſſing by the Petition of Eternal things, will rather ask any thing tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or fading; and by the Vileneſs or Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Prayer, will rather incurr the Offence, than obtain the Favour of his Judge. (<hi>cap.</hi> 24.)</p>
                  <p>This Prayer therefore, though it may ſeem to contain all plenitude of Perfection, becauſe either inſtituted or eſtabliſhed by the Authority of our Lord himſelf, yet doth it promote thoſe of his Family to that higher State, which we mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, and lead them, in a more eminent degree, to that fervent, ineffable Prayer, known or experienced by very few, which tranſcending all humane Senſe, is not diſtinctly delivered by any manner of Words or Expreſſions, but which the Mind, illuſtrated by the infuſion of that Coeleſtial Light, doth, not ſignifie by humane and narrow Eloquence, but pour out abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as out of a full Fountain, in full compacted Senſes, and ineffably utter to the Lord, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſo great things in that little point of time, as the Mind can neither eaſily utter, nor

                  <p>WHEN I was a Child, and lived with Abbot <hi>Theon,</hi> this brutiſh Cuſtom was impoſed upon me by the Enemy, that after I had eaten with him at the ninth hour, I did every day ſecretly convey one Bisket into my Boſom, which I did after, without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, eat in ſecret. Which Theft, though I did conſtantly, through my accuſtomed Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, commit; yet when I had gratified my Appetite, coming to my ſelf, I was more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Guilt of my Theft, than ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with what I had eaten. And when I was every day compelled, to the grief of my Heart, to perform that moſt troubleſome work, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as it were, by <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Task-Maſters inſtead of Bricks upon me, nor could extricate my ſelf from this their moſt cruel Tyranny, and was aſhamed and confounded to diſcover the ſecret Theft to my Senior; it came to paſs, by the Hand of God, who was pleaſed to reſcue me out of the Yoak of this Captivity, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Brothers deſired to come to the Cell of the Senior for Edification ſake. And when they were refreſhed, and a Spiritual Conference was begun, the Senior anſwering to their Queſtions
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:192035:73"/>diſcourſed of the Vice of <hi>Gaſtrimargy,</hi> or Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, and of the Domination (and Slavery) of Thoughts kept ſecret, and did explain their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and moſt diſmal Power ſo long as they were concealed: I by the power of this Conference being prick'd, and terrified with an accuſing Conſcience, as believing that theſe things were ſpoken for that Cauſe, that the Lord had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the Secrets of my Heart to the Senior, I began firſt ſecretly to ſigh; then, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction of my Heart increaſing, breaking out into Sighs and Tears, I pull'd the Bisket, which by that evil Cuſtom I had ſecretly ſtolen to eat, out of my Boſom, where it was conceal'd, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it to them, I did proſtrate upon the ground with Supplication for Pardon, confeſs how I did every day eat in ſecret, and with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Tears did implore them to beg my Abſolution from this hard Bondage of the Lord. Then ſaid the Senior; <q>Be of good Comfort, Child; Thy Confeſſion hath obtained thy Abſolution, though I hold my Tongue: For thou haſt this day gotten the Victory of thine Enemy, more powerfully beating him down by thy Confeſſion, than thou thy ſelf wert caſt down by him through thy Concealment. Whom not at all checking either by thy own or any others Reprehenſion, thou didſt ſuffer to domineer over thee till now. But now, after this thy Confeſſion, that wicked Spirit
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:192035:73"/>ſhall not be able to diſquiet thee; nor ſhall the filthy Serpent any longer hold a hiding place in thee, being drawn-out into the Light, out of the Darkneſs of thy Heart, by a ſalutary Confeſſion.</q> The Senior had not finiſhed theſe Words, and behold a Burning Lamp, proceeding from my ſide, ſo filled the Cell with the ſmell of Brimſtone, that the Stink of it would not ſuffer us to remain in it. And the Senior re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming his Admonition; <q>Behold, ſaith he, our Lord hath viſibly proved to thee the Truth of my Words, that thou ſhouldeſt ſee with thy Eyes the Inſtigator of thy Affection driven out of thy Heart by a ſalubrious Confeſſion; and ſhouldſt know that the detected Enemy ſhould no longer at all have place in thee, by his manifeſt Expulſion.</q> And ſo it is, according to the Sentence of the Senior, the Domination of that diabolical Tyranny in me is, by the Virtue of this Confeſſion extinct, and for ever layed; ſo that the Enemy never after attempted to inject ſo much as the memory of this Concupiſcence, nor have I ever after felt my ſelf aſſaulted by any Inſtigation of that thieviſh deſire.</p>
                  <p>In this manner therefore may we moſt eaſily come to the Science of <hi>true Diſcretion,</hi> if follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tract of the Seniors, we preſume neither to act any thing new, nor to determin it by our own Judgment; but walk in all things as their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:192035:74"/>Tradition, or Probity of Life ſhall inform us. In which Inſtitution being ſettled, any one may, not only come to the perfect reaſon of Diſcretion, but remain ſafe againſt all the Snares of the Enemy. For by no other Vice doth the Devil draw a Religious perſon ſo headlong to Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as when he doth perſwade him, neglecting the Advice of the Seniors, to confide in his own Judgment, and Determination or Doctrin. For ſince all Arts and Diſciplines found out by humane Ingenie, and which are of no more benefit than for the Commodities of this temporal Life, though they may be handled with the Hand, and ſeen with the Eyes, yet can they not rightly be comprehended by any one without the Teaching of an Inſtructor; How improper is it to believe that this only ſhould not need a Teacher, which is inviſible and occult, and which is not ſeen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through but with a moſt pure Heart, wherein an Error produceth not a temporal Damage, nor what is eaſily repaired, but perdition of Soul, and perpetual Death? For it hath a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict Day and Night, not againſt viſible, but inviſible Enemies; and not againſt one or two, but againſt innumerable troops, a Spiritual Combat, the Caſe of which is ſo much the more pernicious to all, by how much both the Enemy is more miſchievous, and the Encounter more ſecret. And therefore is the Trace of the Seniors always to be followed with the utmoſt
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:192035:74"/>Diligence, and to them are all things, which ariſe in our Hearts, taking away the Veil of Baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, to be related. (<hi>cap.</hi> 11.) <hi>v. ſup.</hi> p. 79.</p>

                  <p>GREAT indeed and wonderful are the things, nor throughly known to any Man, except only to thoſe who have experience of them, which the Lord with ineffable Liberality gives to his Faithful ones, even in this Veſſel of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Which the Prophet viewing in Purity of Mind, as well in his own Perſon, as in the Perſon of thoſe, who come into this State and Affection, cryed out; <hi>Great are thy Works; and that my Soul knoweth very well.</hi> Otherwiſe could not the Prophet be thought to have ſaid any rare or great matter, if he be thought to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced this either with other affection of Heart, or concerning other Works of God: For there is no Man, who doth not acknowledge the Works of God to be wonderful, even from the very Vaſtneſs of the Creation. But of thoſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:192035:75"/>things, which by his daily Operation he doth produce in his Saints, and with a ſpecial Bounty doth pour out unto them, no other can be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but the Soul of them who enjoy it, which, in the ſecret of its Conſcience, is ſo the only Judge of his Favours, that it not only cannot with any Speech relate them, but not ſo much as in Senſe and Thought comprehend them; when deſcending from that inflamed Fervour, it ſinks down to material and terrene Proſpects. For, Who would not admire the Works of God in himſelf, when he ſees the inſatiable <hi>Greedineſs</hi> of the Stomach, and the coſtly and pernicious <hi>Luxury</hi> of the Palate, ſo reſtrained in Him, that he ſeldom (and unwillingly) takes ſcarce ſo much as a little, and that very mean Food?

Theſe indeed are the wonderful Works of God, which the Souls of the Prophets and ſuch (experienced Perſons) do know in a peculiar manner, being amazed with the Intuition of ſo wonderful a Contemplation.

                  <p>The <hi>Watch</hi> (or Guard) is the Manner of every ones Soul, according to which he doth receive Divine Viſions in a certain proportion.

                  <p>THE Life of the Body, is the Soul; the Life of the Soul, is God. The Spirit of God dwells in the Soul, and by the Soul in the Body, that our Bodies alſo may be the Temple of the Holy Spirit, whom we have from God. <hi>Ser.</hi> 18. <hi>de verb. Apoſt. c.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>It is not unreaſonable to ſay, That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal Soul is ſo illuminated with the Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Light of the Simple (or pure) Wiſdom of God, as the Body of the Air is illuminated with the Corporeal Light, and as the Air grows dark upon the departure of that Light. 11 <hi>de Civ.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Minds</hi> are to <hi>Souls</hi> as their <hi>Senſes;</hi> but of Sciences whatever things are <hi>most certain,</hi> they are ſuch as are thoſe things which are illuſtrated or ſhined upon by the Sun, that they may be ſeen, as the Earth and all Earthly things.

                  <p>It is a great and very rare thing, with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeneſs of the Mind to tranſcend all Creature,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:192035:81"/>corporeal or incorporeal, being conſidered and found mutable, and to approach to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Subſtance of God, and there learn from Him, that none but he made all Nature, which is not Himſelf. For ſo God ſpeaks with Man, not by any corporal Creature ſounding in corporal Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he ſpeaks by the very Truth it ſelf, if one be fit to hear with the Mind, not with the Body. 11 <hi>de C.

                  <p>One thing there is that I can preſcribe thee: I know no more. That theſe <hi>ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things</hi> are wholly to be <hi>forſaken;</hi> and that we muſt greatly beware while we act this Body, that our Wings, which we need have intire and perfect, be not hindered by any of their Birdlime, that we may fly away from this Darkneſs, to that Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore, when thou ſhalt be ſuch, that nothing of Earthly things doth at all delight thee, believe me, in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the ſame point of time, thou ſhalt ſee what thou deſireſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Soliloq. c.</hi> 14.</p>

                  <p>Confide conſtantly in God, and as much as thou canſt commit thy ſelf intirely to Him. Do not be willing to be as it were thine own, but profeſs thy ſelf to be a Servant of the moſt Gracious and Bountiful Lord. For ſo will he not ceaſe to raiſe thee to Himſelf, and will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit nothing to befall thee, but what ſhall profit thee, though thou knoweſt it not. 1 <hi>Soliloq.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>Hear me, my God, hear me after that manner of thine <hi>known to very few.</hi>— Command, I beſeech thee, whatever thou wilt, but heal and open my Ears, that I may hear thy Voice: Heal and open my Eyes, that I may ſee thy Becks.— Say to me, which way I ſhall look that I may behold Thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Soliloq. c.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>Being admoniſhed to return to my ſelf, I entred into my moſt inward parts, thou being my Leader: and I could do it, becauſe thou waſt become my Helper.

Nor was it as of the ſame kind greater, as if it grew more and more clear than it, and filled all with its Greatneſs. This was not that, but another, quite another from all thoſe. Nor was it ſo above my Mind, as Oyl above Water, nor as

Thou art my God; for Thee do I ſigh day and night. And when I firſt knew Thee thou didſt aſſume me, (or take me up) that I ſhould ſee it to be which I did ſee; and my ſelf not to be, who did ſee. And thou didſt beat back my weak Sight, ſhining vehemently upon me; and I trembled with Love and Horror, and found my ſelf to be far from Thee in the Region of Diſſimilitude, (or Unlikeneſs) as if I heard thy <hi>Voice</hi> from on high; <hi>I am the Food of grown Perſons; grow, and thou ſhalt feed on me. Nor ſhalt thou change me into thee, as the Food of thy Fleſh; but thou ſhalt be changed into me.</hi> And I know that for Iniquity thou doſt tutor Men, and makeſt my Soul to pine away like a Spider. And I ſaid, <hi>Is Truth nothing, becauſe it is diffuſed, neither through finite, nor through infinite ſpaces?</hi> And thou cryedſt from a far, <hi>Yes indeed,</hi> I AM THAT I AM. And I heard, as it is heard in the heart; and there was no cauſe of doubt at all left; and I could eaſilier doubt that I was alive, than that Truth was not, which is ſeen being underſtood by the things which are made. 7 <hi>Confeſſ. c.</hi> 10.</p>

                  <p> More to this purpoſe might be noted out of theſe, and others of great Authority in the Chriſtian Church; though it may be obſerved that anciently the Chriſtians, as well as the Jews and Heathens, were very cautious not to expreſs the Myſteries of their Religion to the Prophane, or to ſuch as were not capable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Saviour's Admonition, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. and out of that caution, and a like caution to avoid all Oſtentation and ſecure their Humility, were more ſparing in their Expreſſions of any thing of this nature in their Writings, than thoſe of after-Ages, who, by degrees, began to write more openly, and at laſt to compoſe whole Books of what was before taught more ſecretly to particular Perſons, as they were capable to receive it; but this is ſufficient for the preſent.</p>
                  <p>By this Taſt of the <hi>Spirit of theſe Holy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> together with the Teſtimonies of ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Perſons as were contempory with them, and well acquainted with their <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> we may judge of the Raſhneſs and Inconſiderateneſs of many of later times, who have made no ſcruple to deſpiſe, vilifie, and reproach the <hi>Monaſtick State</hi> in general; and the Impiety and Wickedneſs of ſuch as have induſtriouſly endeavoured to rake up all the Dirt, and raiſe all the Calumnies and Slanders they could againſt them.

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE great <hi>Prejudice,</hi> which in this last Age was raiſed <hi>againſt Monaſtick Life and Monks,</hi> ſo greatly eſteemed in the most flouriſhing Ages of the Church, did proceed, not ſo much from any Evil in the thing, or in the perſons at that time, though much degenerated from the Virtue of the Ancients, as from the Wickedneſs and Sacriledge of ſuch as were greedy of their Revenues and Riches, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwillingneſs of others to bear the Yoak, they had taken upon them. This is ſo manifest, that whoever ſhould proceed to that degree of Diſingenuity and Impudence as to deny it, would juſtly forfeit all Credit with Men of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Impartiality afterward. It is true, there was too much occaſion given for ſuch as had a mind to rake up all the dirt they could against them; yet even in that ſcarce any who have ſet themſelves to that work, have contained themſelves within the bounds of Truth and Modeſty, much leſs of Charity; but their Malice and Prejudice may
<pb facs="tcp:192035:87"/>be perceived upon a very ſmall inſpection into their Writings. In this wicked Work, beſides all thoſe who were directly concerned in it, many others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, partly as Advocates, in hope of ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment or Advantage from ſuch as were poſſeſſed of the Prey; partly to ingratiate themſelves with the Party; and partly through an indiſcreet igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Zeal, eaſily carried with an overflowing Stream.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>miſchievous Conſequences</hi> of this were many and great; of which, to paſs by others, one is no leſs than want of ſound Education in true Chriſtian Piety and Virtue, even in our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities ever ſince, but too manifest in the Effects: and another no leſs than that, even the making the Word of God of none effect, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending and diſparaging, and eluding even what our Saviour recommended to all, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to none, undermining the very Principles of the most Heroick Virtue and Piety of the most Holy Chriſtians, by an abominable Antichriſtian Preſumption, requiring no leſs than a Publick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of all the Proteſtant Churches. For theſe, and others of this nature, it is that the Bleſſing of God hath not been upon the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but only a Protection, nor is it probable ever will, till the Reformation it ſelf be reformed; but that they will either dwindle away, as they have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, till they come to nothing; or fill up the meaſure of their Iniquities, till they bring ſome great Judgment of God upon them.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:192035:87"/>
                  <p> Such inconſiderate factious Zealotes as call this <hi>Popery,</hi> know not what they ſay; but do Honour to <hi>Popery,</hi> Injury to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and Prejudice to their own <hi>Cauſe.</hi> But ſo mad and heady have they been, that ſober Men, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood better things, have been forced to apologize for barely mentioning the <hi>Monaſteries,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Tanner</hi> hath truly obſerved, in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>Notitia Monaſtica;</hi> who, notwithſtanding, hath very worthily dared to ſay, That <hi>Monaſteries were in thoſe dark Ages the only Preſervers of Learning, and Maintainers of Hoſpitality:</hi> That <hi>Orders and Statutes for the Relief of the Poor were never known till after their Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:</hi> and, That <hi>their Founders were Men of the greateſt Honour and Virtue in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Ages.</hi> In his <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Antiquity of Monaſteries among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> is not certainly known. It is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which Mr. <hi>Tanner</hi> ſaith after Sir <hi>George Mackenſy,</hi> that the Original of <hi>Monks</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> may be dated from the first Plantation of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> therein; <q>and that ſome of the <hi>Druids</hi> having been converted from the <hi>Pagan Religion,</hi> whereof they were the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> became our <hi>firſt Monks;</hi> being thereunto much inclined by the Severity of their former Diſcipline.</q> And the ſame is certainly more than probable concerning <hi>Egypt,</hi> that the <hi>Therapeuts,</hi> whatever they were before, were converted ſome of the first, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb facs="tcp:192035:88"/>their way of living afterward; for none could be more diſpoſed to receive the Goſpel; nor can any other account be with any probability given of them. And <hi>Monaſteries</hi> there were in <hi>Egypt</hi> before St. <hi>Antony,</hi> as appears plainly by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Life, <hi>(c. 3. p. 6.)</hi> and more fully by <hi>Socrates, (lib. 4. c. 23.)</hi> who ſaith, <hi>That</hi> Monaſteries <hi>in</hi> Egypt <hi>had their Original from very great Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but they were inlarged and much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by a pious Man, whoſe Name was</hi> Ammon; of whom <hi>Athanaſius</hi> makes mention in the Life of <hi>Antony, (c. 32.)</hi> which <hi>Socrates</hi> alſo takes notice of. So that the Queſtion men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in his Life of <hi>Paul,</hi> is plainly to be underſtood, not who were the firſt <hi>Monks,</hi> nor who were the firſt <hi>Anchorets;</hi> but who were the firſt <hi>Eremites,</hi> who retired ſo far as into the Deſart? for <hi>Athanaſius</hi> mentions an <hi>old Man,</hi> when St. <hi>Antony</hi> began, who had obliged himſelf to a <hi>Solitary Life</hi> from his Youth; and, doubtleſs, many ſuch there were from the beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: but ſuch Societies there were alſo of <hi>Women,</hi> before St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s time; to one of which he commited his Siſter, as appears in his Life; and of whom St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> gives us a noble Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. <hi>Apolog. p. 698.</hi> to. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there being none of whom we have any ſuch particular and authentick account of their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> more ancient than St. <hi>Antony,</hi> none
<pb facs="tcp:192035:88"/>could be more proper to begin with for Example of the <hi>Heroick Piety and Virtue of thoſe Ancient Chriſtians,</hi> than his, being written by ſo Eminent and Excellent a Perſon as St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> whoſe deſerved Character the <hi>Engliſh Reader</hi> may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe in Dr. <hi>Cave,</hi> collected out of the Ancients.</p>
                  <p>And for <hi>the LIFE</hi> it ſelf, that it was written by <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> and ſoon after Tranſlated by <hi>Evagrius</hi> into <hi>Latin,</hi> is ſo atteſted by the Ancients, as is beyond all queſtion; and the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Diſagreement too, by reaſon of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which <hi>Evagrius</hi> ſaith he took in Tranſlating of it, which is between the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Latin</hi> Copies now extant, is ſo remarkable, and all ſo agreeable with what is ſaid of it, or out of it, by the Ancients, as renders all little <hi>Cavils</hi> and pretended <hi>Doubtfulneſs</hi> greater Blemiſhes to their Writings, Candor and Integrity, who abuſe People with ſuch Pretences, than it can be to either the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Copies, which ſo mutually confirm the Truth of each other, and with the concurrence of other Teſtimonies, make ſuch a triple cord, as nothing but greater regard to Factions and Parties, than to Truth and Honeſty, would ever attempt to break. Why are not ſome others reckoned doubtful, for which there is more colour; but that one ſerves their turn, but the other not?</p>
                  <p>But undoubtedly there is a certain Secret Cauſe of ſome Peoples Prejudice against this Holy Life: His <hi>Heroick Virtue and Devotion,</hi> is a tacit
<pb facs="tcp:192035:89"/>Reproach to their Lazineſs and Tepidity; His <hi>Miracles,</hi> to their Want of Grace; which makes that ſeem incredible to them, which they ſee nothing of among themſelves: and hence they catch at any thing to bring all into queſtion; as, his <hi>Combats with Devils,</hi> (c. <hi>7.</hi>) though certainly written by St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and cited out of him by <hi>Ruffinus, Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Nicephorus;</hi> and the like related by others, and even in our own times; the <hi>Smell of Spirits;</hi> (c. <hi>35.</hi>) as if it was not common for foul Spirits to leave a Stink behind them; or that we must deny Credit to all Relations of that kind, even amongst our ſelves, becauſe not agreeing with our fine-ſpun imaginary Notions of Spirits: and <hi>the uſe of the Sign of the Croſs,</hi> both recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to others, and practiſed by himſelf; as if that was not the Common Practice of Chriſtians long before his time; and the triumphant Erecting of Croſſes ever ſince <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time at the least; (<hi>See</hi> Euſebius<hi>'s Life of</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>l. 1. c. 28,—31, 40. and l. 2. c. 7.—</hi>) and we had bravely mended the matter, by ſetting up inſtead of it the Effigies of the Dragon upon our highest Spire without, and the Enſigns of the Beast over our Altars within, in many of our Churches, as real Emblems or Repreſentations of our Eſtate and Condition, as if there was indeed ſome Magical Enchantment in them.</p>
                  <p>We may argue and cavil at ſuch things as theſe; but where is the Virtue and Divine Power, which
<pb facs="tcp:192035:89"/>accompanied that Holy Man? If we judge by our Saviour's Rule, we ſhall find little but empty Talkers among thoſe, who exclaim moſt against theſe things; and magnifie the Active Life above the Contemplative: What does their Activity produce? <hi>Antony,</hi> we ſee, converted great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to forſake their Eſtates, and embrace the State recommended by our Saviour to all, who could receive it: But how many do we ſee by theſe Orators converted from their Covetouſneſs, Vanities and Superfluities, to Obedience to the poſitive Commands of Christ? In <hi>Antony</hi> the Power and Spirit of Chriſtianity ſhined gloriouſly even in the ſight of Heathens and Infidels; but our Little Morality makes our ſelves ſuſpected firſt, and then our Religion too for our ſakes; and gives great occaſion to ſuch as have more Wit than ſolid Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to turn <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Deiſts;</hi> and ſuch as have ſome ſenſe of Religion, to turn <hi>Separatiſts</hi> or <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> Nay, the very <hi>Reading of this Life</hi> hath produced more noble Convertions, than all their Preachings and Writings, put all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who cavil at it: whereof we have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances in St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s <hi>Confeſſions, l. 8. c. 6.</hi> And, indeed, how can they expect the Bleſſing of God upon their Labours, who ſo unadviſedly oppoſe ſo conſiderable a part of the Doctrine of our Saviour in general, and reſist his Inſpirations in ſuch as conſult them in their own particular caſes? Is this the way to prepare a
<pb facs="tcp:192035:90"/>People for the Lord? They may do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what they ſhall anſwer, when they are called to account for it; and be more wary in ſuch caſes, that they do not obſtruct the Work of God, but, as they ought, promote it.</p>

                     <p>WHETHER they were <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or any others, who were the firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners of that <hi>(Monaſtick) Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> this is confeſſed of all, That that Great <hi>ANTONY</hi> the Monk did excellently practice that kind of Life with proper Exerciſes and Actions of <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Perfection;</hi> whom at that time growing famous in the Deſarts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> in Honour of his Vertue, received into his Favour and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, honoured him with his Letters, and deſired him to write to him for what he had occaſion. He was an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> Born of a Noble Family at a place call'd <hi>Coma,</hi> which is a Village near <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclea.</hi> When he was a well-grown Youth,
<pb facs="tcp:192035:90"/>the Lands deſcended to him from his Father, he gave to the People of the place; and ſelling the reſt of his Eſtate, he diſtributed the <hi>Price</hi> amongſt the Poor. For he conſidered that it was the part of a Student of Philoſophy, not only to deprive himſelf of his Eſtate, but to diſpoſe of it in a decent manner. While he lived with others of his time ſtudious of Philoſophy, he imitated the Virtues of all of them. And becauſe he conceived that a Good Life, although hard and difficult at the beginning, would, by Cuſtom, become eaſie and pleaſant, to thoſe meaſures of ſevere Exerciſe of his Continence, which he firſt began with, he daily added ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and, as if he always began, ſtill renewed his Reſolution and Alacrity of Mind, chaſtizing ſenſitive Pleaſures with corporal Severities, and reſiſting the Affections of his Mind with a Wiſe and Divine Reſolution. His <hi>Food</hi> was only Bread and Salt, and his <hi>Drink</hi> Water, and <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi> his Dinner time. But he often continued <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ſting</hi> two days, or more. He <hi>waked</hi> almoſt continually whole Nights, and continued in <hi>Prayer</hi> even till Day; and if he did take any <hi>Sleep,</hi> it was only <hi>upon a Mat.</hi> But for the moſt part he took the <hi>Ground</hi> or <hi>Floor</hi> for his Bed. He refuſed anointing with <hi>Oyl,</hi> and the Uſe of <hi>Baths,</hi> and ſuch like things; becauſe they, with their Humidity, are wont to diſſolve and relax the firmneſs of the Body. And it is reported,
<pb facs="tcp:192035:91"/>that he never ſaw himſelf <hi>Naked. Book Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> he neither underſtood, nor admired; but a Good Mind he commended as more ancient, and the Inventer of it. He was very Meek, Civil, Prudent, Magnanimous, courteous to ſuch as came to him, and not unpleaſant to thoſe, who talked with him, even though they talked croſsly: For he did wiſely, by his Behaviour and Skill, allay the heat of Contention as it aroſe, reduced it to Moderation, and the Perſons to more compoſed <hi>Behaviour.</hi> When, by ſo great Virtues, he had obtained abundance of Divine <hi>Fore-knowledge,</hi> he did not account it a Virtue to fore-know: and therefore neither did he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe that any one ſhould lightly trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the Fore-knowledge of Futurities. And he judged, that neither he, who is ignorant of future things, ſhould for that incur Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor he, who had Knowledge of them, to be in that reſpect Happy, or to be emulated. For true Felicity, he ſaid, was to Worſhip God, and Obſerve his Laws. But, ſaid he, if any one be deſirous of this Prae-ſcience or Fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, let him purifie his Mind. For by this means he did reſolve that the Faculty of Fore-ſeeing, and the Science of future things, might, by Divine Revelation, be obtained. But neither did he indure to be <hi>idle;</hi> and he directed any who deſired to live well, to work; and day and night to enter into Examination and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb facs="tcp:192035:91"/>with himſelf of his Deeds: and if any thing was done otherwiſe than it ought, to write that down, that thenceforward he might beware of Sins, and be cautious of himſelf, if he ſhould find many ſuch things written, as fearing leſt if that writing ſhould be found, it might appear to others how bad he had been. He was an excellent and moſt induſtrious Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for ſuch as were <hi>oppreſſed;</hi> and for the ſake of ſuch often went to Cities: For many, with their lamentable Complaints, prevailed with him to interceed for them with Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: For all of them reckoned it a great Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs if they could have the opportunity to ſee him, hear him Diſcourſe, and receive his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. But although he was ſuch as he was, yet did he endeavour to live unknown and in Solitude. And when at any time he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to go to the City, to ſuccour any in want, as ſoon as ever he had diſpatch'd the Buſineſs for which he came, he preſently haſted back to his Retirement. For <hi>Fiſhes,</hi> ſaid he, do live in the Water; but Solitude is the Element for <hi>Monks:</hi> Thoſe, if removed to dry Ground, die; theſe, if they approach the City, loſe their Monaſtick Compoſedneſs. Toward thoſe who looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him he endeavoured to behave himſelf ſo, as neither to be, nor to be judged proud.</p>
                     <p>Theſe few things concerning the <hi>Converſation</hi> of <hi>Antony,</hi> I thought neceſſary to ſay, that taking
<pb facs="tcp:192035:92"/>them for Examples, we may by them judge of the reſt of his Philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>He had many very Eminent <hi>Diſciples,</hi> of whom ſome flouriſhed in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Libia,</hi> others in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and in <hi>Arabia.</hi> And each of them lived, among thoſe where they lived, as their Maſter did, and inſtructed many in the like Virtue and Philoſophy, ſo that it was hard for one, who did diligently viſit Cities and Countries, to meet with his Aſſociates or Succeſſors: For how could ſuch eaſily be met with, who more induſtriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to live conceiled and unknown, than other Mortals of the World, out of a vain Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition do to be known?</p>

And preſently being ſuddenly filled with a Holy Love and modeſt Shame, he, angry at himſelf, caſt his Eyes upon his Friend, and ſays to him, <hi>Tell me, I pray thee, whether do we aſpire to arrive by all theſe our Labours? What do we ſeek? For what do we ſtrive? Can our Hope be greater in the Court, than to be Favourites with the Emperor? And what is there there not frail and full of Dangers? And by how many Dangers do we proceed to greater Danger? And how long ſhall this be? But if I would be the Friend of God, behold, I am made ſo preſently.</hi> This he ſaid, and being in Labour in the bringing forth a New Life, he turned his Eyes again to the Book, and read on, and was inwardly changed where God only ſees, and his Mind was ſet free from the World, as preſently appeared. For as he read, and rouled over the Waves of his Heart, he ſometimes groaned, and conſidered, and, at laſt, reſolved upon better things; and having given up himſelf to God, he ſaith to his Friend, <hi>I have now broken off from thoſe hopes of ours, and have reſolved to ſerve God; and this I begin from this very hour in this very place. If thou be'eſt loth to follow me, do not hinder me.</hi> The other anſwered, <hi>That he would ſtick to his Companion in ſo great an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement,
<pb facs="tcp:192035:93"/>and of ſo great Merit.</hi> And both, now being Religious, have built the Tower (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) with the proper Expence of Leaving all and following Chriſt, and fixing their Heart in Heaven remain in that Cottage.</p>

                        <hi>Two other Courtiers,</hi> who had parted from them, and been walking in other parts of the Gardens, coming to call them to return, they told them their Reſolution, and how it was wrought and confirmed in them: At which they, though not yet ſo reſolved, fell into Tears, and congratulating their State deſired their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. But <hi>two Virgins,</hi> to whom theſe Converts had been contracted, when they heard of it, did likewiſe conſecrate their Virginity to the Lord.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>St. Auguſtin himſelf</hi> was ſo affected with the Relation of it by <hi>Potitianus,</hi> who was one of thoſe who returned, that it was a chief occaſion of his Converſion, and after many Conflicts in himſelf, which he expreſſeth very pathetically in the next chapter, he broke out at laſt into theſe earneſt Expreſſions to his Friend <hi>Alipius: What do we ſuffer? What is this? What haſt thou heard? The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned get up, and take Heaven by force; and we with all our Learning, without heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold where we wallow in Fleſh and Blood.

                  <p>And ſince you have an earneſt deſire of being inform'd, How St. <hi>Antony</hi> firſt entred upon an Aſcetick way of Living; and what manner of Man he was before; and what ſort of End he made at laſt; and whether the Reports that have paſs'd about him are true; in order, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, to bring your ſelves to an Emulation of him; and hereupon have thought fit to requeſt an Account of his Conduct from my hands: Be ye hereby ſatisfy'd, that I have received your Command, and received it with great Affection too; for the Truth of it is, the bare Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of St. <hi>Antony,</hi> is a Matter of great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to me: Beſides too, I am very well ſatisfy'd, that when you have had an Account of this Man, you will admire him ſo, as to rival and tranſcribe his Example; which indeed is a Pattern ſo exact, that any Monk may form his Solitude by it; and therefore I dare adviſe you not to diſ-believe what-ever you may have heard concerning him; but rather to look upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reports, as ſtrange as they may ſeem, to fall far ſhort of what St. <hi>Antony</hi> did and was: for truly his Fame does not come near his Worth. And I muſt needs ſay, that what I ſend now to you concerning him in this Letter, by reaſon of the Urgency of your Requeſt, is only an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:192035:94"/>Relation of ſome few Paſſages of his <hi>Life,</hi> which are ſtill freſh in my Memory. And I deſire you by no means to leave off Enquiring about him of Paſſengers from all Quarters; for I am perſwaded, did every one ſpeak what they knew of him, his Life would be found a Task too great for any Biographer to undertake to perfect it: For which reaſon, as ſoon as your Letter had reach'd my hands, I thought fit to ſend for ſome of thoſe Monks who us'd fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to viſit him, that by their Information my Narrative might be a little fuller than 'tis now. But becauſe the ſcantineſs of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens time and the haſt of the Pacquet-Boat ſtraiten'd me ſo, that I could not tarry till they came; I have us'd my utmoſt Diligence to acquaint your Reverences with all that I knew my ſelf, (for I have often ſeen him) and could learn from a Perſon who was his Servant no ſmall time, and us'd to pour the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on his Hands when he waſhed. I have all along ey'd the Truth, ſo that who-ever hears more than he will find here, may ſafely give Credit to what he hears. Who-e'er knows leſs of him cann't chuſe but have great Thoughts of St. <hi>Antony;</hi> but how-ever, cann't revere him ſo much as he ought who Reads this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. ST. <hi>Antony</hi> was <hi>Born</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> both of Rich and Noble, (&amp; what is better than both) of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:192035:95"/>Chriſtian Parents. And indeeed his exact Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Life was a clear Evidence of his Chriſtian Birth. During his Childhood he was always kept at home, being an utter Stranger to every Body but his Father's Family. And after he was a little grown up, he could not endure to go to School, purely becauſe of an inbred Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to keeping Company with other Children: For he had a ſtrong deſire to live, as we read of <hi>Jacob,</hi> like a plain Man dwelling in Tents. When his Parents us'd to carry him to Church, (though but a Child) he did not appear Liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs or Lazy: Neither, as he grew up, did the leaſt ſign of a refractory Spirit appear in him: But he was always very Obedient to his Parents, and Attentive to the Prayers and Homilies, and ſtrictly careful to reap ſome Profit to his Soul from what he heard. Though he ſaw his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had a great Eſtate, yet he never was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for dainty Victuals, or variety of Diſhes, being not in the leaſt ſolicitous about matters of that kind; but was always pleaſed with what-ever was provided, and never deſired any thing elſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. At about Eighteen or Twenty Years of Age, at the moſt, he was left an Orphan, with an only and very young <hi>Siſter,</hi> and truſted by his Parents, (notwithſtanding he was ſo young) when they dy'd, with the Management of the whole Family and Eſtate, and the Education of his Siſter. Before Six Months after their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:192035:95"/>Deceaſe was expir'd, as he was going (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Cuſtom) to Church, and ordering his Faculties into a fit frame for Devotion, that Text (<hi>Matt.</hi> 19.27.) of the Apoſtles <hi>leaving all</hi> to follow their Saviour, came particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Mind in the midſt of his Walk; as alſo concerning thoſe who in the <hi>Acts</hi> (Act. 4.35.) <hi>Sold their Eſtates, and brought and laid them at the Apoſtles feet, to be diſtributed as every one had need;</hi> and what, and how great an Hope remains laid up for them in Heaven: With theſe Thoughts he went into the Church. Now it happened on that Day, that that part of the Goſpel was read where we read our Lord ſaying to the Rich Man, <hi>Matt.</hi> 19.21. <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, Go ſell all thy Poſſeſſions, and give unto the Poor, and then come and follow me, and thou ſhalt have Treaſure in Heaven.</hi> This Leſſon St. <hi>Antony</hi> apply'd (as particularly directed to him) to himſelf; and hereupon embracing the Remembrance of the generous Example of thoſe Saints, as injected into his Mind by God himſelf, accordingly parted with the Eſtate of an ancient Family, in all 300 Meaſures (which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> call <hi>Arours</hi>) of very rich and fertile Land, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed the Money, for which he ſold it, among the Inhabitants of the Village where he liv'd; that neither his own nor his Siſter's Mind might be encumbred with it any longer. His Moveables he alſo Sold, and gave the Money to the Poor.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:192035:96"/> 3. And having reſerv'd ſome ſmall matter for his Siſter, the next time he went to Church he heard our Lord ſay in the Goſpel, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.34. <hi>Take no thought for the Morrow:</hi> And therefore, without any more delay, he e'en went out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and diſtributed that too among the Poor. And having given her in Charge to ſome experienc'd and truſty Virgins, to be Educated in their Cloyſters, he betook himſelf to an Aſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Life without doors, keeping a very cloſe eye upon himſelf, and leading a very rigid and abſteinous Life; for at that time there ſcarcely were any ſettled Monaſteries in <hi>Egypt,</hi> neither did any Monk live in a remote Wilderneſs: But whoever had a mind to order himſelf very ſeverely, exercis'd himſelf in ſome ſolitary Place not far from his own Town. At this time there was an Old Man in a neighbouring Village that had obliged himſelf to a ſolitary Life from his Youth. St. <hi>Antony</hi> having obſerv'd him, was inflam'd with Emulation, and at firſt continu'd alone in ſome place <hi>or other that was</hi> hard by the Village. And where-ever he heard of any ſtudious and zealous <hi>Courter of Vertue,</hi> like a provident Bee, he would be ſure to go and find him out, never returning to his own Abode till he had ſeen him, and could bring ſomething back with him, which might ſerve for part of a <hi>Viaticum</hi> to bear up his Spirit in his Progreſs to Heaven. After he had continu'd thus ſome time,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192035:96"/>he ſquar'd his Mind with ſuch exactneſs, as to <hi>reſolve never to return again</hi> to the Place where <hi>his Anceſtors Seat</hi> was; nor ſo much as to bear the ſecular Concerns of <hi>his Relations</hi> in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory any longer; that he might intirely apply his Mind and Affections to a vigorous Aſſiduity in Aſceticks. And therefore <hi>he wrought with his own Hands,</hi> becauſe 'tis written, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Let not the Idle eat.</hi> Part of what he got by his Labour he ſubſiſted on himſelf, and part of it he gave to the Poor. He <hi>Prayed</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, becauſe he had learnt that we ought to pray inceſſantly in private. He attended ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> when read, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fell to the ground from him, but he held it ſo faſt, that his Mind was as good as a Library to him. For the ſake of his Demeanour, he was <hi>belov'd</hi> by all: He <hi>ſubmitted,</hi> with great readineſs, to all virtuous Perſons whom he viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: He would, with great diligence, by himſelf mark every <hi>virtuous Perſon's</hi> Vertue, for which he was peculiarly Eminent, and ſtamp them upon himſelf. In one, he would obſerve an Obligingneſs of Carriage; in another, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied Fervour in Prayer; in a third, Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit; in a fourth, great Condeſcention and Charity: He would very affectionately eye this Perſon's great Sprightlineſs, Vigilance, and moderate uſe of Sleep; and another Man's Affability, Delight in the Scriptures, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:192035:97"/>in Conferences on Spiritual Subjects: Here he admir'd one for his Fortitude, Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, Patience, and Courage; there another for his Faſtings, hard Lyings upon the Ground, and other ſuch like Arts of ſubduing the Body: But principally, and above all, he would ſeal on his Heart and Soul that Piety and vehement Affection for Chriſt, and ſtream of mutual Love, which was very obvious and legible in them all. Thus he us'd conſtantly to go back to his own Cell always fraught with ſuch <hi>uſeful Obſervations</hi> as theſe; making himſelf the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory of all thoſe Excellencies he could ſpy in others; whence he was wont to elicit and diſplay them in a bright and exemplary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. All the Conteſt he had with thoſe of the ſame Age with himſelf, was, to be ſecond to none of them in <hi>Chriſtian Diſcipline:</hi> In which ſort of Victories he behaved himſelf ſo modeſtly, that no body fretted at him for Envy; but rather, on the contrary, took delight in taking Notice of him; inſomuch, that the whole Neighbourhood that had any regard for Vertue, and all with whom he convers'd, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Goodneſs, us'd to call him <hi>Theophiles,</hi> or God's Friend: The Elder, calling him Son; and the Younger, Brother.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But <hi>the Devil,</hi> who is envious, and hates eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is commendable, could not endure to ſee ſuch a noble Purpoſe in ſo young a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:192035:97"/>but made it his Endeavour to thwart all his Deſigns to his Diſadvantage.</p>
                  <p>At firſt he ſtrove to bring him off of his Aſcetick Courſe of Life, by throwing into his Mind a Remembrance of his Eſtate, of the Nearneſs of his Relations, and a Solicitude for them; a Love of Money, and Deſire of Glory; great Varieties of Pleaſure, and other ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations of the Methods of the World; as alſo, Thoughts of the Ruggedneſs of Vertue, and how much Labour it coſts a Man to obtain it; and, to mention no more, of the Weakneſs of his Body, and the long Remainder of his Life. In ſhort, the Devil rais'd a great deal of duſt in his Thoughts, that by bemudding and diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Mind, he might make St. <hi>Antony</hi> let go his Deſign. But as ſoon as the Enemy ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too weak to foyl St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Reſolution; and quite contrariwiſe, that he himſelf was emaſculated by the Holy Man's Steddineſs, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by a mighty Faith, and fall'n by reaſon of his continual and earneſt Prayers, he aſſum'd a new Boldneſs and Confidence in thoſe Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons which he knows every Man carries about him in his own Fleſh againſt himſelf; for here he moſtly lies in Ambuſh againſt the Souls of the Young. Accordingly he renews his Aſſault againſt the Youth, Night and Day attacking him with great Turbulence; inſomuch, that ſtanders by could eaſily diſcern a Combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:192035:98"/>them; for the Devil threw <hi>filthy Thoughts</hi> into his Mind; and the Young Man routed them out as faſt by Prayers: the Adverſary us'd his Policies to make his Body diſſolute, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious; on the other hand, St. <hi>Antony</hi> fortify'd his Soul, and us'd his Body hardly, and kept it under by Faith, and Faſtings, and Tears, and earneſt Addreſſes to God. But ſtill the Devil, though worſted, was very hardy, and <hi>appeared</hi> to him in the <hi>Shape of a Woman,</hi> repreſented Beautiful in all reſpects, only to impoſe upon St. <hi>Antony.</hi> But <hi>Antony,</hi> by placing the noble Extract of his Spirit and intellectual Power in a clear view before himſelf, quench'd this Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand of Deceit. Nevertheleſs the Devil would yet be hinting the Softneſs and Affectingneſs of this Pleaſure; on the other hand, <hi>Antony,</hi> like an enraged and exaſperated Perſon, by revolving in his Mind God's Menaces of Fire, and the Toyl of thoſe Furrows which the never-dying Worm ploughs in the Conſciences of the Damn'd, eſcap'd free without being hurt, or ſo much as ſing'd by his Temptations. All which daſh'd the Enemy mightily out of countenance; for, he that once thought of being equal with God himſelf, was now ſlighted and baulk'd by a Young Man; and he that generally vaunts and vapours ſo inſolently over Fleſh and Blood, was now over-thrown by a Man, even whilſt he wore his frail Body of Fleſh: For our Lord, who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:192035:98"/>wore Fleſh Himſelf for our ſake, and gave the Body a Conqueſt over the Devil, wrought and wreſtled together with this Holy Youth. So that every one who ſtrives in good earneſt with the Devil, may, with good reaſon, ſay, <hi>Not I, but the Grace of God with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.57. At laſt, the Devil perceiving that he could not overthrow and diſcourage <hi>Antony</hi> by this Device, gnaſhing his Teeth, and being like one beſide himſelf to ſee himſelf drove out; he, who is really black in his Nature within, <hi>appear'd</hi> in the form of a <hi>Black Boy to Antony,</hi> and as it were lying at his Feet, (for the crafty Spirit being turn'd out of his Heart, now no longer invaded his Thoughts) aſſum'd an Humane Voice, and ſaid; I have deceived many, yea, verily, I have worſted and deceived very many: But having now exerted my Strength againſt thee, as againſt many others, I have been weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd and overcome. Who is this (ſaid <hi>Antony</hi>) that talks thus to me? The Devil anſwer'd in a wretched whining Tone; To this Day I have ply'd ſoft fleſhly Allurements in Young Perſons, and have been call'd, The Spirit of Fornication. How many, when willing to be Sober, have I deceiv'd? How many have I, by Hypocriſie, and ſenſe-affecting Motions, drawn aſide? I am he of whom the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Ye have been deceiv'd by the Spirit of Fornication:</hi> 'Twas by me that they were tripp'd up: I am
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:192035:99"/>he who have ſo often diſturb'd thee, and as often been humbled by thee. <hi>Antony</hi> therefore having paid his Thanks to God, and being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more valiant in Spirit, ſaid; Hence 'tis plain that thou art very contemptible, for thy Soul is black and ſwarthy, and thou art weak as a Child; neither will I, for the future, give way to any Solicitude upon thy Account; for the Lord is my Helper, and I ſhall look down upon mine Enemies with ſcorn; which he had no ſooner ſaid, but the Black Monſter fled away, being afraid to ſpeak or come near the Heroe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This was St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s <hi>firſt Conflict</hi> with the Devil; or rather, (to ſpeak properly, and as I ought) this was our Lord's firſt defeat of the Devil in <hi>Antony,</hi> who, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. <hi>Condemn'd Sin in the Fleſh, that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh, but the Spirit.</hi> But for all this St. <hi>Antony</hi> did not neglect himſelf, as if the Devil were intirely under his Feet: Nor did the Enemy, as though vanquiſh'd, deſiſt from forming Stratagems; for he rang'd about, like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking out ſome pretence againſt him. <hi>Antony</hi> had learnt from the Holy Scriptures that the Wiles of the Devil are many continually, and therefore continually gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to exerciſe; conſidering, that ſince the Devil could not deceive his Heart by Pleaſure, he would try the more ſubtlely and diligently to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:192035:99"/>do it by other Methods; for the Devil is Sin's ſure Friend. Wherefore <hi>Antony</hi> tam'd his Body more and more, leſt after he had conquer'd in ſome Combats, he ſhould be dragg'd a Captive by him in others. Hence he reſolves to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom himſelf to <hi>ſeverer Diſcipline</hi> ſtill. At which Reſolution many were ſtartled through ſurprize. But however, he went thorow with it very patiently; for the bent of his Soul ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laſted a long time, wrought ſuch a good habit in him, that he ſeiz'd on every, even the leaſt Occaſion of exerting his ſtrenuous purſuit after Vertue.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He <hi>watch'd</hi> ſo very much, that oft-times he lay without Sleeping all Night long; and this not once, or ſo, but very often, to admiration. He <hi>eat</hi> once a Day, after Sun-ſet; ſometimes but once in two Days; nay, and ſometimes but once in four Days. His Diet was Bread and Salt: His Drink only Water. Inſtead of a Feather-Bed, he <hi>lay</hi> on a Mat; and ſometimes on the bare Ground. He never anointed himſelf, becauſe he ſaid 'twas more proper for the Younger to addict themſelves to Aſcetick Exerciſes, than to ſeek out thoſe things which effeminate the Body: They ſhould rather accuſtom themſelves to labour, and to bear the Apoſtle's ſaying in their Mind, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. <hi>When I am weak, then I am ſtrong;</hi> for then (ſaid he) the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Spirit is renew'd, and becomes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:192035:100"/>
                     <hi>Athletick,</hi> when the Pleaſures of the Body lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and are impair'd. This alſo was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Thought of his, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That he did not think it proper to meaſure our <hi>Progreſs in Vertue,</hi> by the length of the Time we firſt ſet out, or by our Retirement, ſo much as by our Divine Deſires, and Longings, and the Encreaſe of our Holy Purpoſe. And therefore he would not remember the Time paſt; but every Day, as though it were the firſt, he would expreſs a more ardent Thirſt and Endeavour after a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advance. Speaking by the way of Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie, that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.14. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that which is behind, and preſſing forward.</hi> And remembring the Voice of the Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> who ſaith, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.15. <hi>As the Lord of Hoſts lives, before whom I ſtand, I will ſurely ſhew my ſelf to day:</hi> for he obſerves from the Prophet's ſaying, <hi>To day,</hi> he did not take a meaſure of the Time paſt; but every day, as if it were, laying the firſt Foundation of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, he ſtudied to approve himſelf ſuch an one as he ought to be before God; pure in Heart, and ready to obey his Will, and no ones elſe. Every <hi>Chriſtian Aſcetick</hi> (ſaid he) ought to ſee and learn within himſelf his own Life from <hi>Elias,</hi> as in a Glaſs.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Antony</hi> having by this time, and by theſe means, recollected and ſimplify'd himſelf, Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>the Tombs,</hi> which were at a conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:192035:100"/>from that Town, having firſt acquainted one of his Acquaintance with it, who ſupply'd him with Bread enough to ſubſiſt upon a good while. When he was got thither, he went into one of the Tombs, and ſhut the door over his Head, and tarried within there by himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now the Devil not being able to away with this, and afraid leſt, in a little time, the whole <hi>Deſart</hi> ſhould be fill'd with Aſceticks, came one night with a great company of Devils, and beat and bruis'd him at that fearful rate, that he lay a long time Dumb, becauſe of the Extremity of his Torments; for he proteſted his Pains were ſo great, that 'twas impoſſible Men ſhould be the Inſtruments of the like. But, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, (for the Lord does not forget thoſe who hope in Him) the Day after an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance came with ſome Loaves to him, who, as ſoon as he had open'd the door, ſeeing him lying along, like a Dead Man upon the Ground, took him up and carried him to the Town-Church, and laid him upon the Pavement, where many of his Relations and Towns-People ſat by him, (as they there us'd to do about the Corps of the Dead.) Now about Midnight <hi>Antony</hi> came to himſelf, and awoke, and ſaw all aſleep but himſelf and his Acquaintance that brought him from the Tombs. <hi>Antony</hi> therefore becken'd to him, and deſired him to carry him back to the Tombs, without diſturbing any of them. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly his Friend carried him.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:192035:101"/> 8. And when he was return'd thither, ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Tomb-top, he tarried within there as before; and not being able to ſtand, becauſe of the Stripes the Devil gave him, he <hi>pray'd</hi> lying proſtrate; and after he had pray'd, he ſaid aloud, <hi>I Antony am here;</hi> I don't run away for your Stroaks or Terrours: <hi>For though you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict more upon me, nothing ſhall ſeparate me from the Love of Christ.</hi> Then he ſung that of the <hi>Pſalmist, Though Hoſts encamp againſt me, yet ſhall not my Heart be afraid.</hi> Thus did <hi>Antony</hi> think and ſpeak: But the envious Enemy, and hater of all Good, wondering to ſee him appear ſo confident in ſpight of all that he endur'd, ſounded his Hounds together, and being burſt with Envy, ſaid; See here, we have not tam'd nor tir'd this Man, either with the Spirit of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, or with our Stripes and Buffetings: on the contrary, he is grown the more daring againſt us; let us therefore ſet upon him ſome other way, (for the Devil has always new Schemes ready at hand to promote his malicious Deſigns.) Wherefore, not long after, they came and made ſuch a great <hi>Noiſe</hi> in the Night-time, that the whole Monaſtery ſeem'd to be ſhook, and the Walls of the Cell to be broke through by the Devils transforming themſelves into the <hi>Shapes of all ſorts</hi> of Beaſts, Lyons, Bears, Leopards, Bulls, Serpents, Aſps, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions and Wolves; every one of which mov'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:192035:101"/>and acted agreeably to the Creatures which they repreſented; the Lyon roaring, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make towards him, the Bull to but, the Serpent to creep, and the Woolf to hare towards him, and ſo, in ſhort, all the reſt, according to their Natural Motions; ſo that <hi>Antony</hi> was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured and mangled with them ſo grievouſly, that his Bodily Pain was greater now than before: However, he was unmov'd, compos'd, wakeful, and himſelf: He groan'd indeed for Bodily Pains, but he had a ſober undiſturbed Mind, and, as't were, laughing, he ſaid; <q>If ye had any Strength, it would be enough for only one of you to come againſt me; but becauſe the Lord hath enervated you, therefore ye thus try to ſcare me by a Multitude; and (which is a manifeſt Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Weakneſs) ye have put on the Shapes of irrational Creatures. If ye have any Power, if ye have receiv'd any Authority, don't delay, but ſeize me: But if ye have not Ability, Why do ye trouble both me and your ſelves in vain? My Faith in God is a ſufficient Seal and Security of his ſtanding by me.</q> The Devils therefore having aſſaulted him a long while to no purpoſe, gnaſh'd their Teeth at him; for they found they mock'd themſelves more than they mock'd him.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Moreover, the Lord did not forget <hi>Antony</hi>'s Bravery at this time, but came to his Help; for as <hi>Antony</hi> look'd up, the Roof of the Cell
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:192035:102"/>was as it were open'd, and there was a Beam of Light ſhooting down, as it were, upon him; whereupon the Devils ſtraitway became Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; <hi>Antony</hi>'s Pain too preſently ceas'd, and the Roof clos'd again. Now <hi>Antony</hi> being ſenſible of the Eaſe that had been ſent him, and that he had gain'd Breath, and reſpite from his Dolours, ſpoke reſpectively to the Viſion, and ſaid; <q>Where waſt thou before? Why did'ſt thou not appear at firſt, that thou might'ſt aſſwage my Pain?</q> And a Voice ſaid unto him, <q>
                        <hi>Antony,</hi> I was here; but I waited to ſee thy Behaviour under this Tryal; and ſince thou haſt valiantly gone through it, and haſt not been conquered, I will always be thy Helper, and make thee famous in all Places.</q> Having heard this, he roſe and prayed, and grew ſo ſtrong, that he perceived he had more Strength now in his Body than he had before; being now near the <hi>35th</hi> Year of his Life.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The Day following, as he was walking out, he found himſelf ſtronger bent to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Religion; and he went to that Old Man (whom I mention'd before) that Night, and would fain have co-habited with him in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart: But the Old Man refuſing, becauſe of his Age, and the Unuſualneſs of the thing, <hi>Antony</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fled into the Mountain. Now the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my again obſerving his Zeal, and being willing to retard it, laid the <hi>ſemblance</hi> of a large piece of <hi>Plate</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:192035:102"/>in his way. <hi>Antony</hi> perceiving his Craft, and ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Devil in the Diſh, chid it after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <q>Whence ſhould this Diſh come hither? This is no beaten Road, neither is here any Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller's tread: If it had been loſt, 'tis too big not to be recover'd again preſently: Doubtleſs it would have been found if they had return'd; and, doubtleſs, had any one loſt it, he would have return'd, becauſe the place is ſo ſolitary. This is certainly one of the Devil's Tricks: But, however, thou ſhalt not impede my Holy Purpoſe ſo: May it periſh with thee.</q> No ſooner was the Word utter'd, but the Plate diſ-appeared, like Smoak before the Fire.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Another time he ſaw not only a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, but real Gold thrown in the way: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was a bad Spirit, or ſome good Power that laid it there to try the Heroe, and to ſhew the Devil that he did not value real Money, he neither told me, nor do I know any more of it then that it was really what it appeared to be. <hi>Antony</hi> wondered at the Abundance of it, and leaping over it, as a Man in a Fright over a Fire, never ſtood ſo much as to look back upon it; but run away ſo faſt and ſo far, that he was latent a conſiderable Time after.</p>
                  <p>And now St. <hi>Antony</hi> continuing ſtill more and more intent upon his Purpoſe, placed himſelf in an empty Caſtle that was on the other ſide of the River; though before he came 'twas full
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:192035:103"/>of reptile Creatures, yet when he went in the Serpents left the Place, as though it had been haunted by an Enemy. Here, after he had ſtopp'd up the Entry, he laid in Bread enough to ſerve him half a Year, (which the <hi>Thebans</hi> often do; nay, ſometimes they will continue without moulding a Year together) and having a continued ſupply of Water within, he winded up his Soul to God. There he continued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in his Monaſtery, having entred it, as a Holy Chancel; neither ſtirring out himſelf, nor taking Notice of Comers; only once in ſix Months he took in ſome Loaves at the top of the Houſe.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Some of his Acquaintance came often to him, and becauſe he would not let them in, liv'd often without doors whole Days and Nights by him, and ſeem'd to hear a tumultuous rout within, bawling and wailing from within, and crying, <q>Get away from our place; What have you to do in the Wilderneſs, ſince you countenance none of our Devices?</q> Thoſe that were without thought it might be ſome Travellers that had got into him by Ladders at the top of the Caſtle; but after they had leant down and peep'd thorow a little crack and ſaw no body, they concluded they were Devils; and being afraid, they call'd to St. <hi>Antony;</hi> but he heeded the Devils more than them; and whereas they expected to have ſeen him dead, they heard him ſaying, <hi>Let God
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:192035:103"/>ariſe, and his Enemies be ſcattered: Let them vaniſh, as the Smoak vaniſheth: As the Wax melteth before the Fire, ſo Sinners ſhall periſh from the Preſence of God.</hi> And again; <hi>All Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions compaſſed me round about; but in the Name of the Lord I ſtav'd them off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. Thus did he lead Twenty Years in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Exerciſe, never ſtirring out, or ſeen by any one. But, at laſt, many others deſiring to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his <hi>Aſcetick Life,</hi> and other Acquaintance coming to him, and breaking open the Door by force, <hi>Antony</hi> came out of the Caſtle, as out of an inacceſſible Sanctuary, being matriculated a Member of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come full of God. The Spectators, when he came out, were in an Amaze, to ſee his Body, that had been ſo belabour'd by Devils, in the ſame ſhape in which it was before his <hi>Retirement.</hi> The <hi>Temper of his Soul</hi> was very pure; neither clouded by Sadneſs, nor ſhattered by Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: Neither Laughter nor Melancholy held him in their Chains: The ſight of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude did not diſturb him; nor their Praiſes make him vain: But he was intirely ſmooth and regular, ſteered by Reaſon and Revelation, and fixed in the primitive State of Nature. Our Lord healed many Sick Perſons by him. He alſo cleanſed many that were poſſeſſed, comforted many that were grieved, and reconciled many that were fallen out, charging them all to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:192035:104"/>none of the Things of this World before the Love of Chriſt; diſcourſing and exhorting them to be mindful of future Goods, and of the great <hi>Philanthropy</hi> of God, who ſpared not his own Son, but gave Him up for us all. He perſwaded many to chuſe a ſolitary Life; and by this means there came to be many <hi>Monaſteries</hi> in the Mountains: So that now the Deſarts were turned into a City by Monks that left their Eſtates and Houſes, and entred themſelves Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Heavenly City.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Once he had an Occaſion to paſs over the Trench of the <hi>Arſenoites,</hi> to ſee ſome of his Brethren Monks; which Trench was very full of Crocodiles; but St. <hi>Antony,</hi> and all that were with him, by the pure Vertue of Prayer, went over unhurt. When he returned to his Monaſtery, he obliged himſelf to very ſevere and youth-like Enterprizes. By his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences he would be continually encreaſing the Fervour of other Monks, and exciting many others to the Love of Exerciſe; and by the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm of his Diſcourſes many more Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were erected; all looking upon him as their Father.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. One Day among the reſt, as he was walking out, he told the other of his Brethren Monks, (who came to him with a deſire to hear him) in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Language, that the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> are ſufficient for Inſtruction:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:192035:104"/>But, nevertheleſs, 'tis decent for us to confirm one another in the Faith by Exhortation, and to chear and anoint each other's Spirits by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Diſcourſes.</hi> Wherefore do ye, my Sons, bring your Father what ye know; and I, who am your Elder, will communicate to you what I know by Experience: But beſure, in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, to take care to be communicative and unanimous; and that now ye have begun, ye don't grow ſlack, nor faint in your Warſare; nor ſay with your ſelves, We have laid out ſo much; <hi>item.</hi> ſo much Time upon Exerciſe: But rather, as beginning every day, let us inlarge our Reſolution; for the Life of Man altogether is very ſhort, if we compare it with future Ages: All our Time is nothing to Eternal Life. Every thing elſe is Sold for its Value, and like is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for like: But the Promiſe we have of Eternal Life is a cheap Purchaſe. For 'tis writ, <hi>The Days of our Life are Seventy Years, and if by great Strength we reach Fourſcore, or more, they are but Labour and Sorrow.</hi> Now, if we ſpend Eighty Years in Exerciſe, we ſhall not reign an Hundred Years for it; but inſtead of an Hundred, we ſhall reign for ever and ever. Again; After we have contended on Earth, our Inheritance will not be upon Earth; but we hold Promiſes of Heaven. Again; After we have laid aſide a Mortal Body, we are cloathed with an Immortal One. Wherefore, Children,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:192035:105"/>let us not faint; neither let us think we lay out much Time for God, or do any great Matters; for the Sufferings of this preſent Life are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that ſhall be revealed. Neither let us think that we have parted with great Poſſeſſions; for the whole Earth is very ſmall, with reſpect to Heaven. For juſt as one who parts with a Mite, for an Hundred Broad Pieces: So, were any one Lord of all the Earth, and parted with it for Heaven, he parts with a Mite, and receives an Hundred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. But if all the Earth is not worth Heaven, then, certainly, he who leaves a few Acres for it, does, in a manner, leave nothing at all. If, therefore, any of us parts with a Manſion, or with Gold, he ſhould neither vaunt nor deſpond: But we ſhould rather conſider, that if we don't leave them for the Sake of Vertue; yet, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when we Die, we often leave them to whom we would not; as the Preacher has minded us. Shall we not therefore leave it for the ſake of Vertue, to inherit a Kingdom? Let us have a Thirſt after true Poſſeſſions; for, What does it ſignifie to poſſeſs thoſe things which we cannot carry away with us? Let us rather acquire thoſe Goods which will follow us into the other World; ſuch as are Wiſdom, Juſtice, Sobriety, Fortitude, Spiritual Prudence, Charity, Love of Wordly Poverty, Faith in Chriſt, Freedom from Anger, Delight in Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:192035:105"/>if we poſſeſs theſe, we ſhall find they will procure us a Manſion in the Land of the Meek. Theſe things duly conſidered no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be <hi>Negligent,</hi> eſpecially if he conſider that he is the Lord's Servant, and ought to ſerve Him. Since therefore every one is his Servant, no one ſhould dare to ſay, I do not work to day, for I wrought yeſterday; or by meaſuring the time paſt, to be idle for the time to come. But every day a true Diſciple of Chriſt will ſhew the ſame Readineſs of Mind, that (as 'tis written) he may pleaſe his Lord, and not run a riſque in the Concerns of his Soul. So alſo let us every day perſevere in Exerciſe, knowing that if we are <hi>Negligent</hi> one day, we ſhall not be pardoned for it, becauſe we did well the day before. No, God is offended with ſuch <hi>Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> as we read in <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> So alſo <hi>Judas,</hi> by one Night's Impiety, loſt the Fruits of his time paſt. Let us therefore, Children, adhere to Exerciſe, and not ſuffer our Spirits to be bejaded: for herein the Lord is our Fellow-Labourer; as 'tis written, <hi>The Lord co-operates for Good with every one that wills and works Good.</hi> Now, in order to our not being Negligent, there is a Noble ſaying of the Apoſtle, on which we ſhould oft medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. <hi>I die daily:</hi> for if we ſo live as thoſe, who conſider they may die every day, we ſhall not ſin. Whence we learn every Day, when we riſe, not to reckon upon our ſtay
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:192035:106"/>till the Evening; and again, when we lye down to ſleep, to ſuppoſe we ſhall not riſe; becauſe our Life is uncertain by Nature; which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence daily meaſures out to us. By being thus diſpos'd, and living ſo every day, we ſhall not offend; nor luſt after any forbidden Object; or be angry with any one; or lay up treaſure on Earth: But thus dying every day, we ſhall be poſſeſſing nothing, and forgive all Offences, being freed from all deſire of filthy <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> reputing it as tranſeunt; always ſtriving, and having the Day of Judgment in our Eye: for a great fear of Eternal Torments takes off the Appetite from exceſs of Pleaſure, and rears up the Soul when it begins to ſtoop. Wherefore, having ſet foot in the path of Vertue, let us advance faſter and faſter: and that we may be Maſters of all Opportunities before us, let none of us look back, as did <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife; for our Lord hath poſitively ſaid, that <hi>No one that puts his hand to the Plough, and looks back, is fit for the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Now, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>look back,</hi> is meant nothing elſe but to change our Thoughts, and to reliſh the Things of this World. Be not ſtartled when ye hear any thing of <hi>Vertue;</hi> neither think ſtrange of the Name; for 'tis not far from us, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us; but the work is in our Power, and an eaſie matter, if we have but an hearty Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Greeks</hi> travel and croſs the Seas to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:192035:106"/>learn Letters; but we need not travel for the Kingdom of Heaven; or to croſs the Seas for Vertue; for our Lord has told us before hand, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.21. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is within you:</hi> Wherefore Vertue ſtands only in need of the Will, ſince 'tis within us, and built up out of us: For <hi>Vertue</hi> conſiſts of a Soul which has a primitive Natural Temper. Now the Mind is ſo when it has that Temper wherein it was created. 'Twas created very beautiful and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; for which reaſon <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Nave</hi> bid the People, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24.23. <hi>Incline your heart unto the Lord God of Iſrael:</hi> as <hi>John</hi> alſo; <hi>Make ſtrait your paths;</hi> for the Soul's being ſtrait or upright, does conſiſt in its having its intellectual Faculty in that poſture in which it was created. Again; When the Soul bends, or is crooked, from Nature's poſture, then the Soul has Evil imputed to it: Wherefore, the Buſineſs is not ſo difficult as ſome make it; for if we continue as we were made, we are in a State of Vertue: But if we purpoſe things that are wicked, we are arraigned before God for wicked Perſons. If this Accompliſhment were ſuch, as that it muſt neceſſarily be procur'd from without us, it would be difficult: But ſince 'tis within us, let us keep our ſelves from evil, filthy Purpoſes; and having received ſo great a Truſt from God, let us keep our ſelves for God, that he may own his Work, when he ſees it ſuch as he made it.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:192035:107"/>Let us contend earneſtly, leſt Wrath tyrannize, or Luſt domineer over it; for 'tis written, <hi>The Wrath of Man worketh not the Righteouſneſs of God:</hi> But <hi>Luſt, when it hath conceived, brings forth Sin; and Sin, when it is finiſhed, brings forth Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſince the Caſe is ſo with us, let us be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely ſober, and, as 'tis written, <hi>Keep our Hearts with all Diligence:</hi> for we have ſhrewd and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile <hi>Enemies,</hi> even wicked <hi>Devils.</hi> To which I add, with the Apoſtle; <hi>We wreſtle not againſt Fleſh and Blood; but againſt Principalities and Powers, againſt the Rulers of this World, againſt Spiritual Wickedneſſes in high places;</hi> for there is a vaſt rout of them in the Air againſt us: Nor are they far from us: But there is a great difference in Devils.</p>
                  <p>But to ſpeak of <hi>their Nature and Diverſity</hi> would take up too much time: A Narrative of that kind muſt be the work of greater Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: That which lies upon us, as neceſſary to be known, is, <hi>their various Subtilties againſt us.</hi> And here be it known, that the Devils were not by Nature, what they are by Name: For God made nothing Evil: But they were created Fair and Good: But having fall'n from an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Prudence, and now wheeling about the Earth, they deceived the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with their Phantaſies. And now, that they envy us <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> they leave no ſtone unturn'd to hinder us
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:192035:107"/>from Entring into the Kingdom of Heaven; leſt we ſhould get thither whence they fell: Wherefore we ſtand in need of much Prayer and Exerciſe, till we obtain the Gift of <hi>diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Spirits;</hi> for when once a Man has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that, he may be able to know, which of them is more, and which leſs Wicked; and whither their different Endeavours moſtly tend; and by what Means every one of them may be conquered and caſt out: For they have ſeveral Wiles and Stratagems. Hence came that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle, and his Followers: <hi>For we are not ignorant of his Devices,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.11. Since therefore we are tempted by them, we ſhould be ſetting one another's Souls to rights. Wherefore, I having partly experienced their Wiles, do now, but as a Child, ſpeak ſomething to you about them. Well then; If they obſerve any Chriſtians, eſpecially Monks, labouring hard to make a conſiderable Progreſs in Vertue, they aſſault and tempt them, by laying continual obſtacles in their way, <hi>(viz.)</hi> evil Thoughts. But, however, we ſhould not be afraid of their Threats; for by Prayer, and Faſting, and Faith in God, they quickly fall. But after they have been thrown, they don't deſiſt; but preſently come again ſubtlely and deceitfully; for if they cann't cheat our Hearts by groſs Pleaſures, they will aſſault us another way, ſtriving to terrifie us by falſe Appearances,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:192035:108"/>and transforming themſelves into the Shapes of Women, Beaſts, Serpents, Bulky Bodies, and Armies of Souldiers: Even then our Hearts ſhould not miſ-give us; for they are nothing, and preſently diſ-appear; eſpecially, if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian immures and fortifies himſelf with the Faith, and the Sign of the Croſs: But ſtill they are very bold and impudent: for when they have been thus vanquiſhed, they ſet upon us another way, and pretend to Prophecy, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell things to come: Alſo to ſcare us, they will repreſent themſelves ſo Tall, as to touch the Cieling, and proportionably Broad, that they may ſteal thoſe away by ſuch Deluſions, whom they could not deceive by their Sophiſtry. But if they find a Soul ſo ſecur'd with Faith, and that Hope which attends true Repentance, as to reſiſt them ſtill; at laſt they bring the Prince of the Devils.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. He ſaid alſo that the Devil often appeared juſt as he is deſcribed in <hi>Job</hi> 41.18, 19, 20. <hi>His Eyes are like the Eye-lids of the Morning. Out of his Mouth go burning Lamps, and ſparks of Fire leap out. Out of his Noſtrils goeth Smoke, as out of a Seething-pot or Caldron.</hi> When the Prince of the Devils makes ſuch a figure, the old Impoſtor ſtrikes Terrour upon Fleſh, and ſpeaks very big. And therefore he is upbraided, where we read; <hi>He eſteemeth Iron as Straw, and Braſs as rotten Wood, and looks upon the Sea
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:192035:108"/>as a Pot of Oyntment, and the deep Abyſs as his Conqueſt; even the Abyſs is to him as a Walk.</hi> And by the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15.9. the Enemy ſaid, <hi>I will, and will overtake.</hi> And again by another Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.14. <hi>I will graſp the whole Earth in my hand like a Neſt, and take it up like forſaken Eggs.</hi> And to ſpeak all in one Word, they often make ſuch Brags and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes only to deceive thoſe who worſhip God. But we that are Faithful ſhould not fear his Appearances; nor give ear to his Words; for <hi>he is a Lyar,</hi> and ſpeaks not a true Word: For, in truth, notwithſtanding all his Vaunting, our Saviour draws him, like the Leviathan, by a Hook. <hi>Job</hi> 41.1. <hi>Like an Ox, he has an Halter upon his Head, and his Noſtrils are bored with a Ring, and his Lips with an Hoople of Diſgrace, like a Fugitive. He is ty'd, like a Sparrow, by the Lord, ſo that we may juſtly deride him.</hi> He and his Crew crawl now like Serpents: So that now he may be trod upon by us Chriſtians. This is a certain Sign that our way of Living mads and croſſes him; for he, who before va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour'd that he would make the Sea like a Pot of Oyntment, and clinch the Earth in his Fiſt, lo! now he cann't ſo much as hinder you from Exerciſe; or keep me from ſpeaking to you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Wherefore we mind not what he ſays; neither do we ſhrink for his Objections and Lies; for there is nothing but a ſeeming
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:192035:109"/>light in them: They are only, as it were, the Portraitures of the Fire prepared for them. They would fain fright us with thoſe Fires with which they will be tormented themſelves; but they are quickly detected in their Falacies, and do not hurt the Faithful: But only give us a ſemblance of that Fire with which the Wicked will be tormented. Wherefore, it behoves us not to fear; for all their Devices, through the Grace of Chriſt, come to nought; for they are full of Guile, and ready to be transformed into all Shapes. Hence 'tis that they often pretend to ſing Pſalms, and cite the Scriptures; and ſometimes whilſt we are a Reading, they give us Ecchoes of what we read; and oft, in our Sleep, raiſe us up to Prayers. And this they will do continually, not ſuffering us to reſt: Nay, and ſometimes they will put on the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Habit</hi> of Monks, and talk like Religious Perſons, that they may deceive us by ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances; and when we are deceived, lead us whither they pleaſe: But we ſhould not give ear (or liſten) to them at all. No; though they wake us to pray, and adviſe us not to eat at all; or pretend to condemn and deject us for thoſe Matters in which they before incouraged us: for they don't do this out of a Principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or Truth; but that they may bring the Simple into Deſpair, and make them apt to ſay, Exerciſe is unprofitable, and ſo make them nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeate
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:192035:109"/>a Solitary, as a very grievous and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome way of Living, and may entangle thoſe who have entred into a Courſe of <hi>Self-Government.</hi> Wherefore a Prophet, whom the Lord ſent, has declared ſuch Miſerable: <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Wo be to him who offers his Neighbours thick dregs to drink;</hi> becauſe ſuch Schemes and Purpoſes do turn us out of the Path that leads up to Vertue: for our Lord Himſelf muzzled the Devils, though they ſpoke Truth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be ſilent; for they did ſpeak Truth when they ſaid, <hi>Thou art the Son of God,</hi> Matt. 8.29. Mark 1.25. leſt with the Truth, they alſo ſlily ſow their Perverſneſs with the more Advantage; and that he may accuſtom us not to hearken to them, though they ſeem to ſpeak Truth; for 'tis very unſeemly for us, who have the Holy Scriptures, and Deliverance by our Saviour, to be taught by the Devil, who kept not his own Station, but ſtudied Diſorder: For this Reaſon he is forbid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16. to quote Scripture; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Wicked, ſaid God, wherefore do'ſt thou utter my Statutes, and takeſt my Covenant in thy Mouth:</hi> for they do pretend, and diſturb all things to delude the Simple: Sometimes they ſtamp, ſometimes they laugh, and ſometimes they hiſs. But when one regards them not, then they weep and lament, as van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed: For this Reaſon the Lord God muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled the Devils. We therefore having learnt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:192035:110"/>this from the Holy Scriptures, ought to reſiſt them, and imitate their Reſoluteneſs and Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems againſt us. Pray eye the Example of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39.2. <hi>Whil'ſt the Wicked was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me I was deaf, and ſtill, and held my peace, even from good Words:</hi> And again, <hi>Like a deaf Man I heard not, and as one who is dumb I opened not my my Mouth: I became like a Man who does not hear.</hi> Wherefore let us not hear them, as being Strangers to us; nor obey them, although they wake us to go to Prayers, or talk about Faſts: But rather let us attend to the Purpoſe of our Exerciſe, and not be deceived by them, who always act with Deceit: Neither let us be afraid, though they ſhould come with Force againſt us, and threaten to kill us: for they are weak, and can do nothing but threaten: But this by the By: But now I think of it, I muſt not think much to ſpeak more largely of theſe matters to you; for a Remembrance of them will be ſafe for you. When our Lord was a Pilgrim upon Earth, the Enemy fell, and his Forces were weakened. For this Reaſon he, a Tyrant, though fall'n, is not at reſt yet; but threatens us with Words. Think of this all of ye, and deſpiſe the Devil. Were they confin'd to ſuch Bodies as theſe, they might poſſibly ſay, Men lie hid, and we do not find them: But when we do find them, we make work with them. But if the Caſe were ſo with them, we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:192035:110"/>might hide our ſelves, by ſhutting the Doors againſt them: But ſince 'tis not ſo; but their Nature, on the contrary, is ſuch, that they can enter in even when the Door is ſhut, and they themſelves are all over, and all about us in the Air, together with their Principal, the DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STROYER; and do always will Miſchief, and are ready girt to do it; and the Devil, as our Saviour hath told us, the Father of Miſchief, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. <hi>is a Murderer;</hi> and we now live a Life of War againſt him: 'tis plain now, that notwithſtanding they are not embodyed, they have no Strength; and therefore their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cannot be imputed to the Confinement of Bodies; for no Place hinders them from laying their Snares; neither do they ſpare us becauſe we are their Friends; neither are they Lovers of Good, to rectifie us: But they are rather more Wicked. And there is nothing about which they are ſo ſolicitous, as to miſchief us, and all the Friends of Vertue, and of the true worſhip of God. But becauſe they are able to do nothing, therefore they are continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and threatning: Could they do any thing, they would not delay; but they would put their Miſchief in Execution; for their Deſign againſt us is inveterate. Ye ſee we are here together, and ſpeak againſt them in ſpight of their Teeth, and they do know that they are weakened by our Proficiency in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:192035:111"/>Had they Power and Authority, they would not ſuffer one of us Chriſtians to live; for Piety is an Abomination to a Sinner. And having not ſuch Power, they wound and vex themſelves the more, becauſe they cannot put their Threats in Execution: This ſhould often be in our Thoughts, that we may not be afraid of them. Had they any Power remaining in them, they would not have came in ſuch a Multitude, or put on ſuch Appearances, or have transformed themſelves for Stratagems ſake. Were it otherwiſe, <hi>the Strength</hi> of one would have ſuffic'd to have done what he liſt. For a Wicked Being, that is inveſted with Power, does not kill in Effigie, or terrifie by Multitudes, but abuſes his Power as he pleaſes: But the Devils being ſtript of their Power, like Actors on a Stage, ſhift themſelves into many Shapes, which only fright Children: And therefore their Weakneſs ſhould render them contemptible in our Eyes. The true An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, (of whom we read, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35.) who was ſent by the Lord, ſtood in no need of Multitudes, or outward Appearances, or Shout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or Clappings, but made uſe of his Power without Noiſe; and ſtrait-way killed an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Eighty Five Thouſand. Only weak Angels ſtrive to terrifie by Phanſies.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. But if any one here ſhould have <hi>Job</hi>'s <hi>Caſe</hi> in his Thoughts, and ask, How came the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:192035:111"/>Devil to do ſo much againſt <hi>Job?</hi> He plum'd him of his Eſtate, kill'd his Children, and ſtruck his Body with a grievous Ulcer. I anſwer ſuch an one, the Devil had no Power; but God gave it him for the Tryal of <hi>Job:</hi> Being able to effect nothing of himſelf, and without leave, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted Power, and got it: And therefore the Devil is the more to be deſpiſed, becauſe he had not Power, ſo much as againſt one Righteous Perſon; for had he had it, he would not have requeſted it. His having begg'd it, not only once, but a ſecond time, ſhews that he had not Power. And truly we need not wonder that he had no Power againſt <hi>Job;</hi> for he could not hurt meer Brutes, without God's Permiſſion. <hi>Matt.</hi> 8.31. He has no Authority, no not ſo much as over the Swine: for 'tis written, that they entreated the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Suffer us to go into the Swine.</hi> Now, if they have no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Swine, much leſs over Men, who were made after God's Image: God alone ought to be feared: As for Devils, they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, not dreaded in the leaſt. The more they level againſt us, the more intent let us be upon Exerciſe; for an upright Life, and Faith in God, is a very ſerviceable piece of Armour againſt them. They are afraid of the <hi>Faſting,</hi> the <hi>Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Vigilance,</hi> the <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> the <hi>Contentedneſs,</hi> the <hi>Contempt of Money</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> the <hi>Lowlineſs and Love of Poverty,</hi> the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:192035:112"/>
                     <hi>Alms</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs</hi> of <hi>Aſceticks;</hi> but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, of their <hi>Piety to Christ.</hi> This is the Reaſon why they make ſuch a buſtle, that there may be none to trample on them: For they are very ſenſible that Chriſtians have Grace given them by our Saviour againſt themſelves: For He himſelf ſays, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.19. <hi>Behold, I have given you Power to tread upon Serpents and Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, and every Power of the Enemy.</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore they pretend to <hi>foretell</hi> future things, let no one preſume to regard them: For ſometimes they tell us of Brethren, that meet us ſome Days after, and accordingly we meet them. But this they do without any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Kindneſs to them, to whom they tell it: For they do it only to perſwade them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them in other Matters; and having once got them in their Clutches, they, at length, find an Opportunity to undo them. Therefore we muſt not give them the Hearing, but reject them, and tell them, We do not want to know ſuch unneceſſary Matters. Beſides too, What wonder is it if they, whoſe Bodies are ſo much finer than Mens, when they have ſeen Perſons ſet out upon a Journey, get before them, and give Notice of it? Has not an Horſeman the ſame Advantage of one who travels on Foot? We need not therefore admire them for this: For they do not foretell of things that are not; God alone knows things before they are. To
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:192035:112"/>how many do theſe Devils run, like Thieves, before-hand, and tell them what we are now a doing, and how we are Diſcourſing againſt them, before any of us depart hence, and acquaint others with it? but, Cannot any that runs do the ſame trick by one that walks gently? To make this familiar by an Inſtance; Suppoſe a Perſon begins to walk from <hi>Thebes,</hi> or any other Town, and the Devils, before he begins to walk, don't know that he will walk; but when they ſee him walking, run before-hand, and give Notice of it before he is come, and accordingly he comes at the time mentioned; Can this be call'd a Prediction? nay, oftimes when thoſe who began to walk return back, they deceive them. In like manner they trifle about the River-Water; for having ſeen many Rains fall in ſome Quarters of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing, that the River will overflow before the Water come to <hi>Egypt,</hi> they run and give Notice of the Flood: Which Men might eaſily do if they could run ſo faſt. They are juſt like <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Spies,</hi> who (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.14.) went up to the top, and ſaw a Perſon coming, before him that tarried below. This is to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell things that are already upon the Anvil, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of foretelling future Events. Thus theſe Spirits tell one another, Such a Perſon is Sick, or the like, only that they may deceive: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, ſhould Providence (as He can) decree any
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:192035:113"/>contrary Accident concerning the Waters, or the Travellers, the Devils have falſify'd, and thoſe that minded them are deceived. Thus <hi>the Propheſies of the Greeks</hi> were pack'd together, and they were deceived by the Devil in former times; and, at length, a period was put to their Deceit: for the Lord came and brought the Devils with their Subtleties to nought. For they ſee nothing of themſelves; but, like Thieves, carry away what they ſee from others: So that they are rather Conjecturers, than Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers. Let no one therefore admire them, if they ſpeak Truth ſometimes: For juſt ſo Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, after they have obſerved in others the ſame Diſeaſes, by Symptoms and comparing, give Notice of them in their Patients. So alſo Mariners and Husbandmen obſerve the Temper of the Air, and, by Uſe, forebode that there will be a Storm, or a Calm, Now, no one ſays, ſuch foretell from Divine Providence; but from Experience and Cuſtom. Wherefore, if the Devils do ſo, they neither deſerve Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor Attention: for, What Advantage can it be to know ſuch things before-hand, if they be true? for ſuch Knowledge as this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contributes to Vertue, nor Good Manners. No one is judg'd for what he does not know of this kind, nor benefitted by having learnt it: But every Man is judg'd by God and himſelf, whether he has kept the Faith, and obſerved
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:192035:113"/>his Commands: To this we ſhould give great Attendance. Our Exerciſe and Contention ſhould be, not to fore-know; but to walk well-pleaſing in God's Sight. And we ought to Pray, not that we may fore-know, nor to requeſt this as the Reward of our Exerciſe; but that our Lord may work with us towards our obtaining a Victory over the Devil.</p>
                  <p>But if we find our ſelves ſolicitous to fore-know, [indeed] let us be pure in our Minds; for, I do believe that a Soul, in every reſpect pure, and brought to its primitive Frame, may become ſo diſcerning, as to ſee, by the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord, both more and remoter Events too, than Devils. Juſt ſo the Soul of <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaw <hi>Gehazi,</hi> 2 Kings 5.25. and the Hoſts ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him, 6.17.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. When, therefore, they come in the Night, and are willing to tell things, or ſay, We are good Angels, believe them not; for they lye: Or, if they praiſe your Exerciſe, or call you Happy, believe them not; neither ſubmit ſo far to them as to hear them. But rather <hi>croſs your ſelves</hi> and your Families, and pray toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ye ſhall ſee them vaniſh: for they are daſtardly, and dread <hi>the Sign of our Lord's Croſs,</hi> becauſe by that our Saviour made them bare, and publickly expoſed them, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if they grow more and more Impudent, and leap about wantonly in various Shapes, don't
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:192035:114"/>be afraid, or attend to them as good Spirits; for, by God's Aſſiſtance, 'twill be poſſible, nay eaſie, <hi>to diſtinguiſh between the Preſence of a Good and a Bad Spirit:</hi> For, the Appearance of <hi>Holy Spirits</hi> is not with Diſturbance and Diſorder, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.19. for, <hi>He will not ſtrive, nor cry, neither doth any one hear their Voice.</hi> But a Good Spirit viſits in ſuch a ſweet and delectable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that Joy, and Tranſport, and Confidence, preſently cover the Soul that is viſited: For, <hi>the Lord is with them, who is our Joy; and the Power of God the Father.</hi> Beſides too, when they viſit, the Thoughts of the Soul are free from Conſternation and Wavering: For the Soul, being enlightened by ſuch a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, views with Eaſe the Spirits that appear. Furthermore, it has a certain deſire of Divine and future things ſeizing it, and is willing to joyn with the Spirits, and to go out with them. And if thoſe, to whom they appear, be afraid of the Viſion, they preſently take away the Fear by Love, as <hi>Gabriel</hi> did from <hi>Zachary,</hi> Luke 1.13. As alſo, the Angel which appeared to the Women at the Divine Tomb, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.5. A Teſtimony of this Truth too, is, that ſaying of the Shepherds in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.10. <hi>Be ye not afraid:</hi> for the Fear of Good Men is not a Fear of Puſillanimity; but it proceeds from the Senſe of the Advent of ſuperiour Beings. So much concerning the Nature of the Viſion of <hi>Good Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:192035:114"/>
                  <p> But the Incurſion and Appearance of <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> is diſturb'd with Noiſe, and Clamour, and Brawling, like the Hurlyburly of untaught Boys, or High-way-men: whence proceeds <hi>Timidity of Soul, Confuſion,</hi> and <hi>Ataxy of Thoughts, Grief, Hatred of Aſceticks, great Deſpondence, Tediouſneſs, Remembrance of Relations,</hi> and <hi>Fear of Death:</hi> in ſhort, <hi>Luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Evil things, Weariſomneſs of Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Diſorderlineſs of Morals.</hi> Wherefore, after you have been frighted with a Viſion, if your Fear be preſently taken away, and there ſucceed in the room of it a Joy unalterable, and you find within your ſelf <hi>Chearfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>Confidence,</hi> and <hi>Refreſhment,</hi> and <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of Thought,</hi> and all the other things which I mentioned before, as <hi>Manlyneſs,</hi> and <hi>Love towards God,</hi> take Courage and pray; for Joy and Steddineſs of Soul diſcovers the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the Spirit that is preſent. Thus <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> when he ſaw the Lord exulted, <hi>John</hi> 8.56. And <hi>John,</hi> when he heard a Voice from <hi>Mary,</hi> Mother of God, leap'd for Joy: But if there be Confuſion in thoſe that appear, and Noiſe from without, and Wordly Phantaſies, and Threatnings of Death, with the other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders above-mentioned, then know that 'tis the Sally of Wicked Spirits. Let this be a <hi>Common Rule,</hi> If the Soul be fearful, there are Enemies in ſight; for they are Devils that don't
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:192035:115"/>take away that Fearfulneſs, as the great Arch-Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> did from <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Zachary,</hi> and the Angel that appeared at the Tomb from the Women: But Wicked Angels, when they ſee Men afraid, they encreaſe their Phantaſies, that they may dread them the more: and ſo, at laſt, they aſſault them, and jeer them, and bid them fall down and worſhip. Thus they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> By this Means they that were not Gods, were falſly called Gods. But our Lord has not ſuffered us to be deluded by the Devil, whom he rebuked, when he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing ſuch Fancies in Him, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.8. <hi>Get thee behind me Satan: for 'tis written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and Him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> Let therefore the crafty one be more and more deſpiſed: For what our Lord ſpake, he ſpoke for our ſake, that the Devil, hearing the ſame Words from us, may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by the Power of the Lord, who ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked them then.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But when we have caſt out Devils we ſhould <hi>not vaunt,</hi> neither when we have cured Diſeaſes ſhould we be lifted up; or admire one that caſts out Devils, or deſpiſe one that does not caſt them out: But, let every one mind every one's Diſcipline, and either imitate or emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it, or rectifie it. For doing of Signs and Wonders is not our Buſineſs: This belongs to our Saviour. Hence, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.20. He ſaith
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:192035:115"/>to his Diſciples, <hi>Rejoyce not becauſe the Devils are ſubject unto you; but becauſe your Names are written in Heaven:</hi> For our having our Names written in Heaven is a Teſtimony of our Vertue and regular Life: But to caſt out Devils is the pure Gift of our Saviour, who gave it. Whence we read, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.22. that to thoſe who glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, not in their Vertue, but in Signs, ſaid, <hi>Lord, have we not caſt out Devils in thy Name? and in thy Name done many Wonders?</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaid, <hi>Truly, I ſay unto you, I know you not:</hi> for the Lord knows not the ways of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. In ſhort, as I ſaid before, we ſhould always pray for <hi>the Gift of diſcerning of Spirits,</hi> that, as 'tis written, (1 <hi>John</hi> 4.1.) we may <hi>not believe every Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. I thought, indeed, now to have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and been ſilent of what concerned my ſelf, and to have contented my ſelf with giving theſe <hi>Memento's.</hi> But that ye may not think I ſpeak theſe things idlely, but do declare them from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and a Knowledge of the Truth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (though I become as a Fool thereby, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Lord knows the Purity of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and that I do not do it for my own ſake, but out of Love to you, and to encourage you,) I will further acquaint you with ſome of them. As oft as they applauded me, when I, in the Name of the Lord, curſed them: when they would be fore-telling the Overflow of the River,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:192035:116"/>and I ask'd them, What need you concern your ſelves about that? when once they came threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſurrounding me, like Souldiers accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and hors'd; and another while fill'd the Houſe with Wild Beaſts and creeping Creatures, and I ſung <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.8. <hi>Theſe in Chariots, and they on Horſes; but we will rejoyce in the Name of the Lord our God;</hi> they were preſently routed by the Mercy of Chriſt. Another time when they came and made an Appearance of Light in the Dark, and ſaid, We are come, <hi>Antony,</hi> to lend thee our Light: but I prayed, ſhutting my Eyes, becauſe I diſdained to behold their Light, preſently the Light of the Ungodly was put out. A few Months after they came ſinging, and talking out of the Holy Scriptures; but I, as though Deaf, hearkened not to them, but prayed that I might abide unſhaken in my Mind. After this they came and made a Noiſe, and hiſs'd and danc'd; but as ſoon as I prayed, and lay along ſinging by my ſelf, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently began to wail and weep, as though they were ſpent: But I glorified God, who pluck'd down their Boldneſs, and expos'd their Fury. Once there came a Devil, very tall in Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that dar'd to ſay, <hi>I am the Power of God,</hi> and <hi>I am Providence, What would'ſt thou have me beſtow upon thee?</hi> But I ſpit upon him, and, having nam'd the Name of Chriſt, endeavoured to beat him; nay, and I ſeem'd to beat him;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:192035:116"/>and he immediately, at the Naming of Chriſt, as great as he was, diſappear'd with the reſt of the Devils. And when he came, as I was faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Monk's Habit, with Loaves in his Arms, and ſaid, <hi>Eat, and take ſome Refreſhment (you toyl more than you need) otherwiſe you will grow weak; for you are a Man:</hi> But I obſerv'd his Stratagem, and roſe up to Pray; which he not enduring to ſee, preſently fail'd, and, going out of Doors, diſappear'd like Smoak. As oft as he laid Gold before me, to touch it, and ſee it, I fell to Pſalmody; and then he would pine. As oft as they beat me with Stripes, I ſaid, <hi>Nothing ſhall ſeparate me from the Love of Chriſt;</hi> and after that they beat one another. However, it was not I that vanquiſh'd them, but the Lord, who ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.18. <hi>I ſaw Satan falling, like Lightning from Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I, my Children, being mindful of the Apoſtle's Saying, apply'd this to my ſelf, that ye may learn not to faint, nor be afraid of the Devil and his Agents. And ſince I have been a Fool in telling this, receive from what I have ſaid a Spirit of Fear, and believe me; for I don't lye. Once one of them knock'd at the Door of my Cell, and when I opened it, I ſaw a tall Figure; and when I asked him, Who art thou? He anſwered, I am <hi>Satan:</hi> ſaid I, What makes you be here? He anſwered, Why do all the Monks, and other Chriſtians, blame me undeſervedly?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:192035:117"/>Why do they hourly curſe me? ſaid I, Why doſt thou trouble them? ſaid he, I don't diſturb them: But they trouble themſelves; for I am weak. Surely they have not read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.7. <hi>O thou Enemy, Deſtructions are come to a perpetual End; and thou haſt deſtroyed Cities.</hi> I have no longer a Place, an Arrow, or a City: There are now Chriſtians every where; and, at laſt, the Deſart is fill'd with Monks. Let them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves, and not curſe me to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Then I admiring the Grace of the Lord, ſaid unto him, <q>Thou art always a Lyar, and never ſpeakeſt Truth: Thou haſt ſpoke the Truth to me (now) againſt thy Will: for Chriſt being come has made thee weak and bare.</q> After he had heard the Name of our Saviour, which ſcorch'd him ſo that he could not endure it, he diſappear'd. If therefore the Devil himſelf owns that he is weak, 'tis our Duty always to deſpiſe him and his Agents. Thus ye ſee how many Wiles the Enemy, with his Hounds, has againſt us: But I, having learnt his Weakneſſes, have ſhew'd my Contempt of him thoſe ſeveral ways which I have mentioned to you. Don't let us ſink in our Minds, or form or entertain Fears within our ſelves, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Leſt the Devil come and overthrow us, and, of a ſudden, take us up, and throw us down, and put us out of Order.</hi> Let us have none of theſe Thoughts, nor be Sorrowful, as though we were
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:192035:117"/>periſhing: But rather let us <hi>rejoyce</hi> and be glad, as being in the Number of thoſe who ſhall be ſav'd; and conſider with our ſelves, that the Lord is with us, who have triumph'd over Devils, and put them to flight; and let us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways think, that, the Lord being with us, our Enemies can do us no harm: for they deal with us differently, according as they find us diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently diſpos'd; and according to the Thoughts which they find within us: Thus, if they find us daſtardly and diſturb'd, they form ſtrange Fancies within us; juſt like Cut-throats and Robbers; they preſently ſeize upon the place which they find unguarded. Whatever we think of our ſelves, to that they will be ſure to add; If we are dejected, they encreaſe our Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merouſneſs, by injecting Fancies and Threats; and ſo the miſerable Soul is tortured by them. But if they find us rejoycing in the Lord, and diſcourſing of Matters that do relate to Him, ſeeing the Soul fenc'd with ſuch Thoughts, they are confounded and turn aſide; becauſe all things are in the Lord's Hand, and a Devil prevails not againſt a Chriſtian. When the Enemy ſaw <hi>Job</hi> immur'd thus, he run away from him: But when he found <hi>Judas</hi> deſtitute of theſe, he took him Captive. So that if we would deſpiſe the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, we ſhould always think of the things that relate to the Lord; and our Souls would be always rejoycing in Hope; and we ſhould ſee
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:192035:118"/>all the Devil's ludicrous Tricks be like Smoak, and they themſelves rather flying than purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For, as I told you before, they themſelves are very fearful, always expecting the Fire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them. Take this therefore for a <hi>Sign</hi> not to be afraid of them; When any Spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, faint not for Fear; But be the Viſion what it will, firſt boldly ask, <hi>Who art thou, and Whence?</hi> and if it be the Appearance of a Good Spirit, thou wilt preſently be ſtrengthen'd with <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophory,</hi> and turn thy Surprize of Fear into Joy: But if it be a Diabolical Appearance, it preſently fails, when it ſees thy Mind ſtrong; for thy asking, Who, and whence art thou? is a Sign of the Ataxy of thy Mind. Thus <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Son of <hi>Nave,</hi> Joſh. 5.13. learnt by asking: and the Enemy was not conceal'd when <hi>Daniel</hi> ask'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Antony</hi> having diſcours'd after this manner, they all rejoyced, inſomuch, that their Love of Vertue was encreas'd, and the Negligence of ſome was ſhook off, and the Opinionativeneſs or Self-Conceit, and Vain-glory of others ceas'd; and all were perſwaded to deſpiſe the Devil's Treachery, admiring the Grace that was given to St. <hi>Antony</hi> by our Lord for his Exerciſe.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. The MONASTERIES now were like ſo many Sacred Tabernacles, full of Divine Choirs, ſinging and delighting in Holy Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and Faſting and Praying, and exulting
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:192035:118"/>in the Hope of future Goods, and working to give Alms, and Exerciſing mutual Love, and unanimous Symphony among themſelves. So that you might ſee there, of a Truth, a Land of Piety and Righteouſneſs by it ſelf: For there was neither an Injurious nor an injured Perſon, neither any Complaint of the Oppreſſour: But a Multitude of Aſceticks, having one and the ſame Ardour for Vertue; inſomuch, that one amongſt the reſt of the Spectatours, ſeeing ſuch Monaſteries, and regular Diſcipline, could not forbear crying out, as we read, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.5, 6. <hi>How goodly are thy Dwellings, O Jacob, and thy Tabernacles, O Iſrael! As the ſhady Vales are they ſpread forth, and as the Parks beſide the Rivers, and as the Tents which the Lord hath fix'd, and as the Cedars by the Waters ſide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. St. <hi>Antony</hi> therefore, oft retiring himſelf into his Monaſtry, daily grew Vigorous in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and groan'd, longing for Manſions in Heaven, becauſe he long'd for them, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the frail Life of Man: When-ever he was about to eat, or drink, or ſleep, or ſerve any other Bodily Neceſſities, he bluſh'd; for he thought upon the Dignity of his Intellectual part: So that oftentimes, when he was going to eat with other Monks, and call'd to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance his Spiritual Food, he refus'd, and retir'd to eat alone, thinking he ſhould bluſh if he was ſeen Eating by them. When he eat alone,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:192035:119"/>'twas purely out of Neceſſity: Sometimes, though very ſeldom, he eat with his Brethren: But, though 'twere with Bluſhing, he took the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to acquaint his Brethren, for their Benefit, that they ſhould lay out their Leiſure rather on their Soul, than their Body, leſt it be weigh'd down by the Pleaſures of the Body, which ought to be in Subjection to it. For our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour has ſaid, <hi>Take no thought for your Life, what you ſhall eat; nor for your Body, what ye ſhall put on:</hi> Do not ſeek what ye may eat, nor what ye may drink, neither aim at high things; <hi>For all theſe things the Nations of the World ſeek; for your Father knows that ye need them; and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. Not long after the <hi>Emperour Maximinus</hi> Perſecuted the Church; and ſome Holy Martyrs being carried to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he left his Monaſtry and followed them, ſaying to his Friends, <hi>Let us alſo go and combat; or ſee thoſe who do:</hi> for he was Ambitious of Martyrdom. But, not being willing to deliver up himſelf, he miniſtred to the <hi>Confeſſors</hi> in the Mines and Priſons, and ſhew'd great Diligence in the Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, comforting and ſpurring on thoſe that were call'd to it, and attending them till they were Crowned <hi>Martyrs.</hi> Wherefore, the Judge obſerving the Fearleſneſs and Aſſiduity of <hi>Antony,</hi> and of thoſe that were with him, ordered that no Monk ſhould appear in the Court, nor ſo
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:192035:119"/>much as live in the City; ſo that all the reſt ſeemed to abſcond that Day: But St. <hi>Antony</hi> took this ſo much to thought, that he waſh'd his <hi>Scapulary</hi> the cleaner the Day after, and ſtood foremoſt on an high place before the Judge's Face. And though all Perſons admir'd at it, and the Governour, as he paſs'd by with his Train, took Notice of it; yet he ſtood unmov'd, ſhewing the Readineſs of the Chriſtians to die: For, as I ſaid before, he wiſh'd to die a <hi>Martyr,</hi> and appear'd very much griev'd becauſe he did not. But the Lord preſerv'd and reſerv'd him for our Benefit, and the Advantage of many more, that he might be a Teacher to many, by the Exerciſe which he learnt out of the Holy Scriptures; for the bare ſight of his Diſcipline inflam'd many others to imitate his Life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he again viſited the <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> as he us'd; and, as it were bound up together with them, he labour'd to ſerve them. But after <hi>that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</hi> in which the Bleſſed <hi>Biſhop Peter</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> ceas'd, he pilgrimag'd and retir'd again to the Monaſtry, where he was daily a Martyr in Conſcience, and fought the Combats of Faith: For there he us'd himſelf to much and ſtricter Exerciſe; for he always faſted. His inner <hi>Garment</hi> was Hair-cloth, his upper of Leather; which was the <hi>Habit</hi> he wore to his dying Day; neither waſhing the dirt off his Body, no, nor ſo much as his Feet,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:192035:120"/>unleſs they were wet by chance, when he waded thorow Water on a Journey.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Now, when he had thus retir'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to continue in that State ſome time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever going abroad, or entertaining any Company. There came to him one <hi>Martinian,</hi> a Colonel, who had a Daughter troubled with a <hi>Devil,</hi> and was very troubleſome to him; and after he had ſtood a long while knocking at the Door, and entreating him to come, and pray to God for his Daughter, <hi>Antony</hi> would not ſuffer him to break open his Door; but leaning out of the top, ſaid, <q>Man, Why doſt thou ſtand crying thus? I am a Man as well as thou: If thou believeſt, pray to God, and 'tis done pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</q> The Colonel therefore pray'd to God with Faith, and went his way, and his Daughter was cleans'd from the Devil. Many other things did our Lord by him: Wherefore we do not read in vain, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you.</hi> For many that were <hi>Sick,</hi> and only ſat without the Monaſtry, by Faith and Prayer were Cur'd. But as ſoon as he ſaw himſelf thus diſturb'd by a great many People, and not permitted to retire, according to his Purpoſe and Deſire, and fearing leſt, from what the Lord did by him, he ſhould be lifted up, or any one elſe, upon that account, ſhould think of him beyond what he ought, he thought, and was reſolved to go to the upper Thebais, where
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:192035:120"/>no body knew him; and having took ſome Loaves of his Brethren, he ſat down by the River Banks, watching for a Veſſel to get over. In the mean while came a <hi>Voice</hi> from Heaven, ſaying, <q>
                        <hi>Antony,</hi> Whither goeſt thou, and wherefore?</q> 
                     <hi>Antony,</hi> without any Commotion, or Diſorder of Mind, (for he was us'd to ſuch extraordinary Occurrences) ſaid, <q>Since the Multitude will not let me be at reſt here, I have a mind to retire in the upper Thebais; and ſo much the rather, becauſe they require things above my Strength.</q> Then reply'd the Voice, <q>Should'ſt thou go thither, thou would'ſt have double the Trouble to undergo: But if thou would'ſt be quiet, indeed, go into the inner Wilderneſs.</q> But, <q>Who (ſaid <hi>Antony</hi>) ſhall ſhew me the way, for I don't know it?</q> And the Voice preſently directed him to ſome <hi>Sarazens</hi> that were travelling that way. Whereupon <hi>Antony</hi> made up to them, and requeſted to walk with them to the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. They, as it were by the Order of Providence, receiv'd him readily. By that time he had travelled with them three Nights and three Days, he came to a very high Mountain. Now, under the Mountain there was fine, clear, cool, ſweet, trembling Water; and without the Plain, a few Wild Palm-Trees that had been neglected. <hi>Antony,</hi> as being ſent thither by God, was in Love with the Place; for this was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:192035:121"/>the Place of which the Voice (that ſpake to him upon the Banks of the River) gave him Notice. Having at firſt took with him ſome of his Fellow-Travellers Loaves, he tarry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the Mount, no Body at all converſing with him. There he kept looking upon it as his own Home. The <hi>Sarazens</hi> having obſerv'd his <hi>Intent</hi> and <hi>Propoſal</hi> to himſelf in Living there, deſignedly paſs'd often that way, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupply'd him with Bread. He had alſo a little Refreſhment from the Palms.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And afterwards the Brethren, like Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren mindful of their Father, took care to ſend to him. But <hi>Antony</hi> conſidering that ſome were toyled upon the account of bringing him Bread, and being willing to ſpare the Monks that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, deliberated with himſelf how he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; and ſo, at laſt, deſired thoſe that came to him to bring him a <hi>Spade,</hi> and a <hi>Mattock,</hi> and a little <hi>Corn.</hi> When he was ſupply'd with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, he walk'd a little way, and having found a little piece of Arable Ground, he Till'd it; and having Plenty enough of Water to water it, he <hi>ſow'd his Grain</hi> there; and thus, ever-after, he was ſupply'd with Bread enough every Year; rejoycing becauſe he was troubleſome to none, and could keep himſelf without being burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fome to any one. After ſeeing ſome coming to him again, he Till'd ſome more Ground, and Planted a <hi>few Herbs,</hi> for the Refreſhment of any
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:192035:121"/>tir'd Traveller. At firſt the Wild Beaſts of the Deſart came, out of pretence for Water, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mag'd his Standing-Corn. One Day, therefore, he pleaſantly took hold of one of the Beaſts, and ſaid to them all, <q>Why do ye hurt me, ſince I don't hurt you? Get ye gone, in the Name of the Lord, and come no more near this Place again;</q> and from that time they, as it were, receiving his Command, never came again: So he kept alone in the inner part of the Mountain, attending to Prayer and Exerciſe. But his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren came and miniſtred unto him, entreating him to let them come once a Month and bring him ſome Olives, Beans, and Oyl, becauſe he was now grown Ancient. Whilſt he lived there, how many Conflicts he under-went, (not with Fleſh and Blood, but with Devils, his grand Adverſaries,) we know very well from thoſe who went to him, who heard Tumults, Voices, and Noiſes, like thoſe of the trampling of Horſes, and claſhing of Arms, and ſaw the Mount full of Wild Beaſts in the Night, and him as it were Fighting and Praying againſt them: But he emboldened the Hearts of thoſe that came to him, and ſtrove upon Bended Knees in Prayer with the Lord. And 'tis worth our while to conſider, with Admiration, that he (though all alone in ſuch a great Wilderneſs) was not afraid of the Devil's Aſſaulting him, nor of the Fierceneſs of many Wild Beaſts and Creeping Creatures; but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:192035:122"/>did literally (as 'tis written) <hi>trust in the Lord, like Mount Sion,</hi> having a Mind unmov'd, and void of Fluctuation: So that (as 'tis written) <hi>Job</hi> 5.23. <hi>the Devils fled, and the Wild Beaſts were at Peace with him.</hi> The <hi>Devil,</hi> therefore, (as <hi>David</hi> ſings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.16.) gnaſh'd upon him with his Teeth when he ſaw him. But <hi>Antony</hi> was comforted by our Saviour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd unhurt, notwithſtanding all his Subtleties and Stratagems. The Devil ſent all the Beaſts and Snakes out of their Holes and Dens gaping upon him, and threatning to bite him. But he underſtanding the Device of the Enemy, ſaid to them all, <q>If ye have received any Authority over me, I am ready to be devour'd by you; but if ye are ſuborn'd by the Devil, tarry here no longer, but get ye hence in an Inſtant; for I am Chriſt's Servant:</q> and they fled at his Word as faſt as from a Whip.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. A few Days after that, as he was at work, (for he always took Care to labour) one ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Door, train'd after him with his Heels ſome of his plyant Twigs which he had wrought together; (for he made little Baskets, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd them with thoſe that came to him for what they brought him) and as he ſtood up, he ſaw <hi>a Beast,</hi> down to the Thighs like a <hi>Man,</hi> but with Legs and Feet like an <hi>Aſs. Antony</hi> only ſign'd himſelf with the Sign of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and ſaid, <q>I am a Servant of Chriſt; If thou
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:192035:122"/>art ſent hither againſt me, lo!</q> I am here. But the Beaſt with his Devils fled ſo faſt, that he fell and dy'd for Haſte. Now, the Death of the Beaſt ſigniſy'd the Overthrow of the Devils; for they did all they could to bring him out of the Wilderneſs, but could not prevail.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Soon after this he travelled with ſome of his Brethren Monks that came to ſee him, and requeſted him to come and live with them a little while. Now the Monks had a <hi>Camel</hi> to carry their Loaves and Water, (for that Deſart was Waterleſs, neither was there any drinkable Water thereabouts, but by the Mount where his Monaſtery was, and thence they had the Water that they took with them.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, their Water failing them whilſt they were upon their Way, and the Heat being very great, their Lives were in Danger; for having ſearch'd all the Places thereabouts, and found no Water, they were not able to walk any longer, but lay down upon the Ground, and diſmiſs'd the Camel to ſhift for its ſelf, deſpairing of their own Lives. Now the Old Man ſeeing them all in Danger, was very much troubled and groan'd, and having ſtept a little way aſide and knelt and pray'd, the Lord preſently made Water ſpring forth out of the Place where he had pray'd; and they all drank and reviv'd, and fill'd their Bottles, and having ſought the Camel found him; for (as it happen'd) the Halter twin'd about a Stone,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:192035:123"/>and held him faſt; ſo they brought him, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd and loaded him, and travell'd ſafe to their Journeys End. And as ſoon as he came to the Outer Monaſteries, they all came and ſaluted him, as a Father. And now there was Joy again in the Mountains, and a new Emulation of Proficiency and Conſolation by mutual Love and Faith. It rejoyc'd <hi>Antony</hi> mightily to ſee the Forwardneſs of the Monks, and his Siſter grown old in Virginity, and become a <hi>Governeſs</hi> over other Virgins. In a ſhort time after he return'd to his own Mountain, whither many that were <hi>Diſeaſed</hi> came to him.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. He would be continually charging all the Monks that came to him, to believe in the Lord, and love Him, and to keep themſelves from filthy Thoughts and carnal Pleaſures, and (as 'tis written in the <hi>Proverbs</hi>) <hi>not to be deceiv'd by the Fulneſs of the Belly,</hi> and to avoid Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, and to <hi>pray continually,</hi> and to ſing before Sleep and after Sleep, and to lay up the Precepts of the Holy Scriptures in their Breaſts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Acts of the Saints, that the Soul being minded of thoſe Precepts, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to their Zeal: but eſpecially he advis'd them to have St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Saying in mind, <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon your Wrath;</hi> and to apply this in Common to every Precept, that the Sun may not only not go down upon their Wrath, but upon any other Sin whatſoever; for 'tis but
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:192035:123"/>fitting, that the Sun ſhould not condemn us for any Wickedneſs in the Day, nor the Moon by Night, for any Sin or Thought. If we would be truly Beautiful, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Advice muſt be kept, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Judge your ſelves: Try your ſelves.</hi> Let, therefore, every one of you take an Account of both his Day and Night Actions; and wherein he has offended, let him leave off; and wherein he has not, let him not glory; but let him continue in that which is Good, and not be Negligent, or contemn his Neighbour; neither <hi>Let him juſtifie himſelf till</hi> (as the Bleſſed Apoſtle ſays) <hi>the Lord come, who ſearcheth into the moſt ſecret things;</hi> for we are often, even to our ſelves, in the dark; as to what we do we are ignorant; <hi>But the Lord comprehends all things.</hi> Wherefore, yielding and aſcribing Judgment to him, let us <hi>be Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent one with another, and bear one another's Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and Judge our ſelves;</hi> and whereinſoever we are behind hand, let us ſtrive to fill up our Defects. And pray let me deſire you to take this Rule as a Preſervative againſt Offending: Let all of us mark and write down all our Actions and Motions, in order to declare them to one another; and ye may be confident, that if we always bluſh to be known, we ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear offending, nay, ſo much as thinking any ill thing; for, Who would Sin a Sin for which he muſt preſently undergo open Shame? By
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:192035:124"/>this Means, who-ever offends cann't be ſecret without lying. By this Means we ſhould never fornicate, as being always in one another's Sight. But by writing and communicating our Thoughts, we ſhall keep from inward Impurity, through Shame of having it known. Let our Paper therefore ſerve us inſtead of the Eyes of our <hi>Fellow-Aſceticks,</hi> that our bluſhing, when we write them down in order to be ſeen, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our Luſting amiſs in any caſe. By keeping cloſe to this Model of Diſcipline, we ſhall have Power to ſubdue the Body, and ſo pleaſe the Lord, and to tread the Wiles of the Enemy under Feet. This he ſaid to all that met him. He us'd to ſympathize and pray together with all Sufferers; and in many Caſes the Lord heard him. When he was heard, he did not boaſt; and when he was not heard, he did not murmur: But he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and in all Circumſtances, gave Thanks unto the Lord. He exhorted Patients to <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering,</hi> and made them know, that <hi>Healing</hi> was not from him, or from Men, but of the Lord, who acts as he pleaſes, both as to what he does, and as to the time when he does it: Such Diſcourſe as this was to them as a Cure, none deſpiſing his Lectures: But thoſe whoſe <hi>Illneſs</hi> continu'd, learnt from him to be patient; and thoſe that were <hi>Cur'd,</hi> not to give Thanks to him, but to God alone. Among others, one <hi>Fronto,</hi> a Courtier, (having a terrible Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:192035:124"/>which eat his Tongue, and juſt affected his Eyes) came in the Mount, and deſir'd <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> to pray for him: St. <hi>Antony,</hi> at his requeſt, pray'd to God for <hi>Fronto,</hi> and bid him be gone, and he ſhould be Healed.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. But <hi>Fronto</hi> having got into his Cell by Violence, and tarrying a whole Day there, <hi>Antony</hi> ſaid, <q>Whilſt you tarry here you cann't be cur'd. Be gone, and by that time you come within Sight of <hi>Egypt,</hi> you ſhall ſee a Sign wrought upon you.</q> St. <hi>Antony</hi> ſpeaking ſo poſitively, he was ſatisfy'd, and went his way; and as ſoon as he ſaw <hi>Egypt</hi> he was rid of his Malady, and became a Sound Man, as <hi>Antony</hi> had aſſur'd him. There is another Remarkable Cure which I muſt not omit.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. A certain Virgin of <hi>Tripolis</hi> had a very terrible and foul Diſtemper; for her Tears, and her Snot, and the running of her Ears, turn'd into <hi>Worms</hi> after it fell upon the Ground; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides too, ſhe was very <hi>Paralytical,</hi> and had very unnatural Eyes. Her Parents having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of St. <hi>Antony</hi> by ſome Monks that were travelling to him, and truſting in our Lord, who (as we read, <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.) <hi>cur'd an Iſſue of Blood,</hi> requeſted that ſhe might travel with them: They granting her requeſt, the Child and her Parents went with them; and when they came, tarry'd without the Mount with <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> a <hi>Confeſſor</hi> and a <hi>Monk.</hi> The other Monks went
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:192035:125"/>in to St. <hi>Antony,</hi> and juſt as they were going to acquaint him with it, he prevented them, and told them of the Child's Diſeaſe, and her Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling with them. Hearing this, they requeſted the Child might be permitted to enter; but St. <hi>Antony</hi> deny'd their requeſt, and bid them go out, and they would find the Child either Heal'd or Dead: For (ſaid he) <q>
                        <hi>Healing</hi> is not an Act of mine; Why ſhould ſhe come to me, who am a miſerable Man? To <hi>Cure</hi> is the Property of our Saviour, who exerciſes Mercy in every Place, over all that call upon Him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has favour'd her and her Prayer, and has manifeſted this particular Inſtance of his <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy</hi> to me, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that he will cure the Child's Diſeaſe there.</q> This caus'd great Admiration amongſt them; and they went out and found the Parents Rejoycing, and the Child Healthy from that time.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. About this time, there had <hi>Two Brethren</hi> entred upon a Journey, and for want of Water, one dy'd upon the way; and the other was not far from Dying too, and therefore, having no Strength to travel, he alſo lay upon the Ground, expecting to die. Now <hi>Antony</hi> was ſitting upon the Mount, and call'd Two Monks to him that were hard by, and ſaid to them, <q>Pray take a Pitcher of Water, and run <hi>Egypt</hi> Road<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; for one of two Fellow-Travellers is already dead, and the other will die too unleſs ye make
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:192035:125"/>haſte; for this was diſcover'd to me as I was a Praying.</q> Accordingly the Two Monks went and buried their dead Brother, and reviv'd the other, and brought him to their venerable Father, who was at the diſtance of a whole Day's Journey from them. If any one ſhould ask, Why <hi>Antony</hi> did not ſpeak before the other dy'd? he asks an improper Queſtion; for the Sentence of <hi>Death</hi> did not belong to <hi>Antony,</hi> but to <hi>God,</hi> who determin'd <hi>Death</hi> for the one, and a <hi>Recovery</hi> by <hi>Antony</hi>'s <hi>inter-Agency</hi> for the other. That which is to be admir'd in <hi>Antony,</hi> is, That he had a Soul ſo ſtay'd and ſedate, as to be ſhew'd things at ſuch a diſtance by the Lord upon the Mount.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. And a little after, as he was ſitting again upon the Mount, he ſaw one lifted up on high from the Mount, and a great deal of Joy in all that met him: He could not but admire, and call the Company Bleſſed, and pray'd to know what that might be. Then preſently came a Voice, and told him, that 'twas the Soul of <hi>Ammun,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Nitria.</hi> Now the diſtance between <hi>Nitria</hi> and that <hi>Mount</hi> is Thirteen Days Journey. The Monks ſeeing the Old Man (for he continu'd an Aſcetick to his Old Age) in ſuch a Maze, deſired to know the reaſon of it. St. <hi>Antony</hi> told them that <hi>Ammun</hi> was dead: For this Monk was very well known among them, becauſe he often came thither, and many Miracles were done by him; of which, this is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:192035:126"/>one. Having once an Occaſion to go over the River <hi>Lycus,</hi> (which was a great Inundation of Waters) he deſired <hi>Theodore</hi> to go at a diſtance from him, that they might not ſee one another Naked, as they ſwam over. Then <hi>Theodore</hi> withdrawing, he bluſh'd to ſee himſelf again Naked: And as he was bluſhing and ſolicitous, he was of a ſudden convey'd to the other ſide. <hi>Theodore</hi> therefore (who alſo was a very Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Man) having ſeen him got over, and not at all wetted with the Water, requeſted to know the manner of his Paſſage: But finding him loth to tell him, he took hold of his Feet, and proteſted he would not let him go before he knew. <hi>Ammun</hi> obſerving the Earneſtneſs of <hi>Theodore,</hi> for the ſake of his Proteſtation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to tell him, after he had engag'd him to tell no Body before he was dead; and ſo told him how he was carry'd over after an inviſible manner, and laid on the other ſide: He did not walk on the Water, nor was the manner of it poſſible to Men, but only poſſible to thoſe whom our Lord permits; as he did St. <hi>Peter.</hi> This <hi>Theodore</hi> told after <hi>Ammun</hi>'s Death. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to St. <hi>Antony.</hi> The Monks to whom St. <hi>Antony</hi> told what he ſaw noted down the Day in a Book: And ſome Brethren that return'd from <hi>Nitria</hi> enquir'd about Thirty Days after, and brought word that <hi>Ammun</hi> dy'd the ſame Day and Hour in which <hi>Antony</hi> ſaw the Soul
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:192035:126"/>lifted up on high; and they greatly admir'd the Purity of <hi>Antony</hi>'s Soul, and wondred how he ſhould immediately know what was done at Thirty Days diſtance, and how he ſaw the Soul carry'd up a-loft. But we have freſh Matter of Praiſe and Wonder from St. <hi>Antony</hi> ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. For <hi>Archelaus Comes</hi> having found him praying by himſelf in the Outer Mount, entreated him on the behalf of <hi>Polycrateia,</hi> (who was an admirable Virgin, and full of Chriſt) for ſhe had a Pain in her Stomach and her Side, by reaſon of extream Exerciſe, and was very weakly all over her Body: Wherefore <hi>Antony</hi> pray'd, and <hi>Archelaus</hi> mark'd down the Day whereon <hi>Antony</hi> pray'd; and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> he found the Virgin well; and having ask'd them what Day ſhe was firſt releas'd from her Weakneſs, he took out the Paper in which he writ down the Time when <hi>Antony</hi> pray'd for her, and immediately ſhew'd them the ſame time writ down in his Paper: So that they were all convinc'd that the Lord deliver'd her from her Pains when <hi>Antony</hi> was, by Prayer, forwarding the Goodneſs of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour towards her.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. He did alſo oftentimes give Notice, many days before hand, of Perſons that were coming to him: Nay, ſometimes he would tell the reaſon of their Journey a Month before hand; as that ſome came only to ſee him, others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:192035:127"/>Diſtempered, others becauſe Poſſeſs'd. And this we all know of all, That none that came to him thought the Labour of his Journey a Trouble, or a Loſs; for every one return'd from him with a Senſe of ſome Benefit receiv'd: But notwithſtanding he ſpoke and ſaw ſuch ſtrange things, yet he would not have any one admire him for it; but rather to admire the Lord, who, by his Power, has granted us (though but Men) a Capacity and Liberty to know Him.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Another time having went down to viſit the Outer Monaſteries, and been prevail'd upon, by requeſt, to go into a Veſſel and pray with the Monks, He and He only perceiv'd a wretched and <hi>terrible Stink;</hi> the Company ſaid there was ſome ſalt Fiſh in the Veſſel; but he perceiv'd another kind of Scent: And whilſt he was ſpeaking, <hi>a Young Man that had a Devil,</hi> and had entred in before them and hid himſelf, cry'd out, and the Devil was rebuk'd by St. <hi>Antony,</hi> in the Name of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> and came out of him, and the Young Man was reſtor'd to his Wits: And then they all knew that 'twas the <hi>Devil</hi> that ſtunk.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. There came to him alſo a Nobleman that had a <hi>Devil.</hi> Now that Devil was ſo terrible, that the Perſon that was Poſſeſs'd was not ſo much as ſenſible that he came to St. <hi>Antony,</hi> and ate his own Ordure. Wherefore, they that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:192035:127"/>brought him begg'd of St. <hi>Antony</hi> to pray for him. <hi>Antony</hi> commiſerating him, pray'd for him, and ſat up with him all Night; and the Noble Youth, on a ſudden, run againſt St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> and hunch'd him. Now thoſe that came with him were very much diſturb'd at it: But <hi>Antony</hi> ſaid, <q>Don't ye be angry with the Youth; for 'tis not he, but the evil Spirit within him: (for being rebuk'd, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to poſt away into ſome waterleſs Places, he was enrag'd, and did this) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore glorifie God for his doing thus againſt me; for that is a Sign that he is a going out.</q> No ſooner had <hi>Antony</hi> ſaid ſo, but the Youth was well and himſelf, and knew where he was, and ſaluted the Old Man, giving Thanks to God.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. Many other ſuch like things did the Monks tell of him; and they all agreed in their Relation. But as wonderful as theſe things are, there are ſtranger things yet to be related; for, as he was going to pray before he eat, about the Ninth Hour, he was in a <hi>Rapture;</hi> and (which is a Paradox) as he ſtood up, he <hi>ſaw himſelf without himſelf,</hi> and ſome other Beings by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as it were in the Air; and, afterwards, ſome other bitter and terrible Beings ſtanding by him in the Air too, and willing to ſtop him, ſo that he did not paſs: But the Angels, his <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Convoys,</hi> withſtanding them; they pretend to exact an Account of him, to ſee whether he was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:192035:128"/>not lyable to them. Now, they would have took the Account from his Birth: But St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Guides would by no means allow of that; and told them, <q>That the Lord had blotted all Faults ſince his Birth: But ever ſince he became a Monk, and promis'd to God, they might exact an Account.</q> Then they having accuſed him of what they could not prove, the Paſſage became free, and preſently he ſaw himſelf, as it were come to himſelf, in a ſtanding Poſture, and whole again. Hereupon, having forgot to eat, he continu'd all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Day and Night Groaning and Praying; for he wonder'd to ſee how many we fight againſt, and through how great Difficulties any Soul muſt needs paſs thorow the Air. He could not but, upon this Occaſion, call to mind that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>the Apoſtle,</hi> Eph. 2.2. <hi>According to the Prince of the Power of the Air:</hi> for, <hi>here</hi> 'tis that the Enemy exerts his Power in Fighting, and attempting to ſtop thoſe who paſs thorow: for this Reaſon he the more earneſtly exhorts Chriſtians, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Take ye the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God, that the Enemy having no Evil thing to ſay of you, he may be aſhamed:</hi> But we, when we had been inform'd of this, remembred the Apoſtle: <hi>Whether in the Body, I know not; or out of the Body, I know not: God knows.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> was wrapt up as far as the Third Heaven, and heard <hi>unutterable Words:</hi> But <hi>Antony</hi> ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:192035:128"/>going up into the Air, and contended till he was free.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. He had alſo another particular Favour: for, as he was ſitting on the Mount in a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſture of Soul, and perhaps gravelled with ſome doubt relating to himſelf (for not long before he had been conferring with ſome who had been converſant with him about the State of his Soul, and what place it ſhould have after this Life) in the Night-time; (ſo that we may truly ſay, he was one of thoſe Bleſſed Men, who <hi>are taught of God</hi>) one call'd to him from on high, and ſaid, <hi>Antony,</hi> Riſe, go forth and look; So he went out (for he knew whom he ought to obey) and ſaw a certain terrible, tall, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Perſonage ſtanding, and reaching up to the Clouds, and, as it were, winged Creatures aſcending, and him ſtretching out his Hands, and ſome of them he ſaw ſtop'd by him, and others flying beyond and above him, and thoſe that paſs'd them carried higher ſtill, without the leaſt Solicitude; upon theſe the Tall Perſon gnaſh'd his Teeth; but over thoſe that fell, he rejoyc'd. And the Voice ſaid unto <hi>Antony,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider on what thou haſt ſeen. And his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding being open'd, he perceiv'd that 'twas the <hi>Enemy of Souls,</hi> who envies the Faithful, and ſeizes on (and hinders the Paſſage of) thoſe who are accountable to him; but that he is not able to ſeize on thoſe who were not perſwaded
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:192035:129"/>by him; for they get out of his reach. Being minded by ſuch a Sight again, he ſtrove the more to make a Proficiency in his Holy Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. But I muſt do him Juſtice, by acquainting you, that he did not tell of theſe things willingly. But being he was long at his Prayers, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring with himſelf, thoſe that were with him would be importunately asking him; ſo that he was forc'd, as a Father who could not hide them from his Children, to tell them: Beſides too, he knew the Purity of his own Conſcience, and that the Declaration of them would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for them; for hereby he ſhewed the Bleſſed Fruit of Perſeverance in Exerciſe, and that in great Difficulties God condeſcends to tender Conſolation to his Servants, even by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. I might alſo tell you, how Patient he was under Afflictions, and how Humble of Soul, and how that Frame of Spirit made him revere the Canons of the Church with a peculiar Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Diſpoſition, and how willing he was that every Clergy-Man ſhould be preſerr'd before him; for he was not aſham'd to bow the Head before Biſhops and Prieſts: And when-ever a Deacon came to him, to be benefitted by him, he diſcours'd uſefully to him: But he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the Exerciſe of the Miniſtry, by Prayer, to him, not being aſham'd to learn himſelf: for oft-times he propos'd Queſtions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:192035:129"/>to give Ear to all that convers'd with him, and own'd himſelf benefitted, if any one ſpoke any thing that was uſeful.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. There was much and wonderful Comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Face. If he was preſent with a great many Monks, and any one ſeem'd uneaſie, that he might have a full View of him, though he did not know them before, yet, paſſing by the reſt, he would run to him, as though he were drew by the Perſon's Eyes. He did not excell others in the heighth or breadth of his Body, but in the Conſtitution of his Morals, and the Purity of his Soul; for his Soul being free from tumult, he always had his outward Senſes free from Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders; ſo that his Countenance derived Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs from his Soul, and the Temper of it was diſcernable from the Motions of his Body; (as 'tis written) <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.13. <hi>A glad Heart makes a cheerful Countenance: But a ſorrowful one makes it ſad.</hi> Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> diſcerned <hi>Laban</hi> to have ſome treacherous Deſign in his Mind, and ſaid unto the Women, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. <hi>Is not the Face of your Father toward me as yeſterday, and the day before?</hi> Thus <hi>Samuel</hi> knew <hi>David; For he had cheering Eyes, and Teeth white as Milk.</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Antony</hi> was known; for he never look'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd, becauſe his Soul was always at Peace. His Mind was conſtantly in a rejoycing Poſture, and therefore he never had a louring Look. He was alſo very admirable and ſtrict as to his Faith and Piety.</p>
                  <p n="41">
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:192035:130"/> 41. He would never hold Correſpondence with the <hi>Meletian Schiſmaticks,</hi> becauſe he knew their Wickedneſs, and Apoſtacy from the Faith; nor with the <hi>Manichees,</hi> nor with any other <hi>Hereticks,</hi> in a Friendly manner, any otherwiſe than to adviſe them to turn to Piety; for he judg'd their Friendſhip and Converſation to tend to the Miſchief and Deſtruction of the Soul. He abominated the Hereſie of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and charg'd all not to go near them, or to hold with their wicked Tenets. Some of the <hi>Areiomanites</hi> having once came to ſee him; as ſoon as he perceiv'd what they were, he chas'd them out of the Mount, alledging their Diſcourſes to be worſe than Poyſon. And when the <hi>Arians</hi> told a Lye, (as though he were of the ſame Judgment with them) he expreſs'd great Indignation againſt <hi>Arius;</hi> and being ſent for by the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and all the <hi>Brethren,</hi> he declar'd againſt them in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> telling them that this was the laſt <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and the fore-runner of <hi>Anti-Christ;</hi> and he added, That the Son of God was not a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made of the things that are not, but the <hi>inviſible Word and Wiſdom of the Father's Eſſence.</hi> Wherefore, 'tis impious to ſay, there was a time when he <hi>was</hi> not; for He was always the Word co-exiſtent with the Father. Wherefore, have ye no communication with the <hi>Arians;</hi> for <hi>Light hath no fellowſhip with the Darkneſs:</hi> For ye, who are pious, are Chriſtians; but they who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:192035:130"/>ſay, that the Son and Word of God, who is of the Father, is a Creature, differ not at all from Heathens, <hi>who ſerve the Creature more than God, who created them.</hi> But do ye believe, that all the Creation groans againſt them, becauſe they reckon the Lord and Creatour of all things, by whom all things that were made were made, a Creature.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. So publickly did all the People ſee that Hereſie which ſo oppoſes Chriſt anathematis'd by this great Man, and therefore abominated them: And all of the City ran together to ſee <hi>Antony.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> alſo, and thoſe that were called their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> came to the Temple, ſaying, We deſire to ſee the <hi>Man of God;</hi> for all call'd him ſo. Alſo the Lord cleans'd many that were Poſſeſs'd, by him, and heal'd many wounded Perſons, and others that were wounded in their Underſtandings: And many <hi>Greeks</hi> deſir'd to touch the Old Man, believing they ſhould be benefitted thereby. By this means there were as many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in a few Days, as us'd to be made in a whole Year. Some Perſons thought the Crowd was too troubleſome to him, and therefore kept Perſons from preſſing upon him: But he was not diſturb'd with them, and ſaid to them, <q>The People are not more in Number than thoſe Devils with which I have contended in the Mountain.</q> When he went away, we went before him.</p>
                  <p n="43">
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:192035:131"/> 43. And as we were juſt at the Gate, as it were, <hi>a Woman</hi> cry'd out, <q>O Man of God, pray tarry a little, for my <hi>Daughter</hi> is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly <hi>troubled with a Devil;</hi> Tarry, I pray thee, leſt I alſo fall into ſome danger, by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after thee.</q> When the Old Man heard her, he willingly tarry'd at our Entreaty; ſo the Woman drew near, and the Maid fell upon the Ground; and when <hi>Antony</hi> had pray'd, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd <hi>Christ,</hi> the Maid roſe up very well, for the Unclean Spirit was gone out of her; and the Maid bleſs'd God, and all the Spectators gave Thanks, and St. <hi>Antony</hi> himſelf alſo was very glad, and return'd to his own abode in the Mount. He was alſo very prudent, and, which is very ſtrange, though illiterate, he was a very piercing and judicious Man.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. Once there came to him <hi>Two Greek Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi> with a deſign to try him (now, at that time, he was in the outer part of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.) St. <hi>Antony</hi> perceiv'd what kind of Men they were by their Looks, and ſpoke thus to them by an Interpreter, <hi>O ye Philoſophers, Why did you trouble your ſelves to come to ſuch a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Fellow?</hi> But they reply'd, That he was not ſo, but very prudent. <q>If ye come to a ſilly Fellow, ſaid <hi>Antony,</hi> your Labour is loſt, and to no purpoſe: But if ye think otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch as I am; for we ſhould imitate all things that are fair and commendable. Had
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:192035:131"/>I come to you, I would have imitated you. Since therefore ye come to me, become ſuch Men as I am; for I am a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
                     </q> But they admiring, withdrew, for they ſaw the Devils dreading <hi>Antony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="45">45. Others alſo met him there, thinking to ſcoff at him, becauſe he had not learnt to read. Said <hi>Antony,</hi> pray anſwer me one Queſtion; <q>Which think ye is firſt, the <hi>Mind,</hi> or the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet?</hi> Whether of the two is the Authour and cauſe of the other, the Mind of Letters? or, Letters of the Mind? They anſwered, The Mind is firſt,</q> and the Inventer of Letters. Well then, ſaith <hi>Antony,</hi> 
                     <q>Whoſo has a ſound Mind, ſtands in no need of Letters.</q> Which Anſwer aſtoniſh'd them, and all that were with them; ſo they went away, admiring to ſee ſo much Underſtanding in a private Man; for though he grew Old in the Deſart, yet he was not Savage in his Carriage, like a Mountaineer; but he was Courteous and Civil. His Mind and Diſcourſe was ſeaſon'd with Divine Salt, ſo that none envy'd him; but all that viſited him took delight in him.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. After this, ſome Pretenders to Wiſdom among the <hi>Greeks</hi> came to him, and demanded of him an account of his <hi>Chriſtian Belief,</hi> and made offers to diſpute ſubtilly with him about the <hi>Divine Croſs,</hi> in order to mock him. St. <hi>Antony</hi> having paus'd a while, and pity'd their
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:192035:132"/>Ignorance, ſpoke very well to them by an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, to this Effect: <q>Which of the Two is more laudable, to confeſs a Croſs, or to charge thoſe whom ye call Gods with Adulteries and Sodomies? For our Confeſſion is a ſign of Manlineſs, and Contempt of Death; but yours are the Paſſions of Laſciviouſneſs. Which is better to ſay, That the Wiſdom of God was not chang'd, but for the ſake of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Beneficence to Men, aſſum'd an Humane Body, that by Communion with the Humane Race, he might make Men partake of a Divine and Intellectual Nature; or, To liken the Deity to Irrational Beings, and ſo worſhip four-footed Creatures, and creeping things, and Statues of Men? For, theſe are the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of your Wiſe Men. Moreover, How dare ye deride us, who ſay, That Chriſt did appear a Man; when ye, deriving the Soul from the [Divine] Mind, ſay, That it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and lapſed from Heaven into the Body? and I wiſh it did not paſs, not only into an Humane Body, but into four-footed and creeping Creatures. Our Faith ſaith, That Chriſt came for the Salvation of Men; but ye erring, ſay, The Soul is not generated. We conſider the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Philanthropy</hi> of God, becauſe this was not impoſſible with God; But ye ſaying, That the Soul is the Image of the Mind, yet attribute Lapſes to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:192035:132"/>it, and fable it to be changeable, and, by conſequence, introduce the Mind as change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Soul; for, ſuch as was the Image, ſuch muſt that of which 'tis the Image neceſſarily be: But when ye have ſuch Thoughts as theſe concerning the Mind, pray conſider that ye blaſpheme the Father of the Mind himſelf. And as for the Croſs, What can ye ſay of it? When ye ſee wicked Men enſnare us, ye ſee we are ready to endure the Croſs, and to contemn Death, whenſoever or whereſoever forc'd upon us. Alas! the <hi>Fables</hi> of the Rovings of <hi>Oſiris</hi> and <hi>Iſis,</hi> and the <hi>Treachery</hi> of <hi>Typho,</hi> and the <hi>Flight</hi> of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and <hi>Gormandizings</hi> of <hi>Children,</hi> and of <hi>Paracide;</hi> What are theſe? Yet theſe are your wiſe <hi>Contrivances</hi> and mighty <hi>Foundations.</hi> But, moreover, How comes it to paſs, that when ye deſpiſe the <hi>Croſs,</hi> ye don't admire the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> ſince thoſe who ſpeak of one, have alſo writ of the other? or, Why are ye, when ye remember the Croſs, ſilent of the <hi>Dead</hi> rais'd, the <hi>Blind</hi> who had their Sight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd, the <hi>Sick of the Palſie</hi> who were heal'd, and the <hi>Lepers</hi> that were cleans'd, and the <hi>walking a Foot on the Sea,</hi> and other <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Wonders,</hi> which ſhew <hi>Christ</hi> not to be meer Man, but God alſo? Truly, to my mind, ye do your ſelves wrong, and have not read
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:192035:133"/>our Writings with Sincerity: But, pray read and ſee that the things which Jeſus did, ſhew Him to be God, pilgrimaging upon Earth for the Souls of Men: But, pray tell us of your great Signs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="47">47. <q>What can ye plead for Irrational Gods, and their Savageneſs? Ye may, if ye pleaſe, fly to ſhelter by Allegoriſing: Let <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> be the Earth; <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s <hi>Lameneſs,</hi> the Fire; <hi>Juno,</hi> the Air; <hi>Apollo,</hi> the Sun; <hi>Diana,</hi> the Moon; and <hi>Neptune,</hi> the Sea: But, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, this does not make it any more the Worſhip of God: This is to ſerve the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures more than the Creatour; for ye have compacted theſe Stories out of the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Creation's being Beautiful: Theſe Works ſhould be admir'd, but they ſhould not have been made Gods; for, by this means, ye have given the Architect's Honour to the things that he Built; which is juſt like paying that Honour to the Houſe, which is due to the Builder; or, the miſ-placing the General's Honour, on the Common Souldiers. Come, anſwer me theſe Queſtions, that we may know why Chriſt's Croſs ſhould be derided:</q> But they heſitating and looking this way and that way, St. <hi>Antony</hi> ſmil'd, and ſaid, <q>Theſe things are their own Proof at firſt Sight. And ſeeing ye lean ſo much on demonſtrative Reaſons, and therefore are not willing we ſhould worſhip
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:192035:133"/>without rational Demonſtration; firſt of all, ſatisfie me about theſe matters, and, eſpecially, How the Knowledge of God is diſcern'd? by Demonſtration of Reaſons? or by the Energy of Faith? and, Which is the Elder, Faith by Energy?</q> or Demonſtration by Reaſon? But they anſwering, <q>That Faith by Energy is the Elder, and the truly exact Knowledge. Very well, ſaid St. <hi>Antony;</hi> for Faith ſprings from the Diſpoſition of the Soul; but Logick is one of thoſe Arts which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the Soul: Wherefore, Demonſtration is not neceſſary for them, who have Energy by Faith; nay, 'tis ſuperfluous; for what we perceive by Faith, you build by Reaſoning: So that oft-times you have not Words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs what we ſee within. Wherefore, Energy by Faith is better and firmer than your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical Syllogiſms.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="49">49. <q>We Chriſtians have not this Myſtery by the Wiſdom of <hi>Greek</hi> Reaſonings, but by the Power of Faith, given us by Chriſt Jeſus from God. And that ye may ſee what we ſay is true; behold, we, who have not ſo much as learnt to ſpell, do believe in God, known by his Works, and a Providence over all things. And that our Faith is operative within, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; for we are ſupported by Faith in Chriſt; but ye by Sophiſtical Strivings of Words. Your <hi>Spectre-Idols</hi> are brought to nought;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:192035:134"/>but our Faith is extended every where. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding your <hi>Syllogiſms</hi> and <hi>Sophiſms,</hi> ye don't perſwade any from <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm;</hi> but we, who preach Faith in Chriſt, weaken your Superſtition; knowing very well, That Chriſt is <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Son of God.</hi> By your Oracles ye don't hinder the ſpreading of Chriſt's Doctrin; but by but Naming Chriſt Crucified, we chaſe thoſe Devils whom ye honour as Gods; where-ever the Sign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> is, there <hi>Magick</hi> is weak, and <hi>Sorcery</hi> has no power. Tell me, Man, Where are your Oracles? Where are the Inchantments of the <hi>Egyptians?</hi> When did all theſe ceaſe, and vaniſh before the Croſs of Chriſt was? Does this therefore deſerve ſo much Deriſion? or, Do not rather the weak things that are brought to nought and baffled by it? This alſo is ſtrange to obſerve; Your Followers were never perſecuted, but honoured by Men in the City; but Chriſt's Diſciples are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and yet they multiply and flouriſh more than yours. Your Tenets, though celebrated and applauded, are broke; whereas the Faith and Doctrine of Chriſt, though derided by you, and often perſecuted by Kings, has fill'd the World. When did the Knowledge of God ſhine ſo bright? or, When did Temperance and eminent Virginity appear ſo much? or, When was Death ſo deſpis'd, as ſince the Croſs
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:192035:134"/>of Chriſt? But no one doubts of this when he ſees the <hi>Martyrs</hi> deſpiſing Death for Chriſt's ſake, and whole <hi>Churches Virgins</hi> keeping their Bodies pure and undefil'd for Chriſt's ſake: Which are powerful Signs, and ſuch as do ſhew that the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> is the only true <hi>Faith</hi> for Piety. Lo! ye, at this very moment, don't believe, but ſeek <hi>Syllogiſms</hi> from <hi>Logick;</hi> but we, as our Teacher ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Not by the Perſwaſion of Wiſdom in Greek Eloquence; but by Faith,</hi> do effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perſwade thoſe that were us'd to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Structures of Reaſon. See, here are ſome afflicted with <hi>Devils,</hi> (for at that time there were ſome ſuch preſent) do ye, by your <hi>Syllogiſms,</hi> or <hi>Magick,</hi> or any other Method that you pleaſe to chuſe, and by invoking your <hi>Idols,</hi> cleanſe them, or your ſelves; or, if ye cann't, lay aſide your Quarrel againſt us, be unprejudic'd, and ye ſhall ſee the <hi>Power</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>Croſs:</hi>
                     </q> And having ſaid ſo, he invok'd the Name of Chriſt, and ſign'd the Afflicted Perſons with the Sign of the Croſs a ſecond or third time, and the Men were preſently whole, and in their right Minds, and gave Thanks to God; and the Philoſophers were amaz'd at the Underſtanding of the Man, and the Miracle which he did. But <hi>Antony</hi> ſaid, <q>Why do ye wonder at this? We don't do it, but Chriſt by thoſe who believe in Him: Do ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:192035:135"/>believe, and ye ſhall ſee that we have not an Art of Reaſoning, but a Faith wrought by Love for Chriſt; which alſo ye may have; and when ye have it, ye will not ſeek De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of Eloquence; but then ye will reckon Faith in Chriſt ſufficient.</q> Theſe were St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Words; but they eſtranging at this went away, ſaluting him, and owning that they were benefitted by him.</p>
                  <p n="50">50.

He was ſo obliging to all, that all look'd on him as a Father.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. After this, he return'd to the inner Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtry, and ſtuck to his former Exerciſe; very often, as he was ſitting or walking with his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitants, he was very ſilent, (as 'tis written in <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 4.16.) and after an hours pauſe he would diſcourſe with the Brethren very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly: But thoſe that were with him fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently perceiv'd ſome Viſion. Once he told all the Affairs of <hi>Egypt</hi> to Biſhop <hi>Serapion,</hi> who was ſometimes within with him, and ſaw him engag'd with a Viſion. Another time, as he was ſitting, he was, as it were, in an Extaſie, and frequently groan'd in the midſt of his <hi>Theory;</hi> and, in an hour's time, returning to his Friends, he firſt ſtood and pray'd trembling, and then kneelt, and continu'd ſo a good while; and when the Old Man roſe he wept. The Company, trembling for Terrour, requeſted to know the Reaſon of it, and were ſo importunate with him, that he was forc'd to ſpeak, after he had fetch'd a great ſigh: <q>Better had it been for me, if I had dy'd before I ſaw that Viſion.</q> Then
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:192035:136"/>they urging him to be particular; he ſaid, <q>Wrath will ſeize upon this Church, and it will be betray'd to Men who are like Brute Beaſts; for I ſaw the <hi>Lord's-Table</hi> encompaſs'd with Mules ſtanding round about it, and Hounds barking within, and all manner of Beaſts making a diſorderly Noiſe. Ye ſaw how I ſigh'd. I heard a Voice, ſaying, <hi>My Altar ſhall be abominated.</hi>
                     </q> This was the Old Man's Viſion. And, about Two Years after, there was an Incurſion of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and the Plundering of the Churches, when they took the Holy Veſſels by Force, and made them be carry'd by Heathens, forcing them out of their Shops to joyn with them, and doing what they pleas'd in their Sight. Then all of us knew, that the Noiſe which the Mules made pre-ſignignify'd to St. <hi>Antony</hi> what the <hi>Arians</hi> now, like Wild Beaſts, are a doing. But as ſoon as he had done ſaying that, he went on, and ſaid; <q>My Children, don't be caſt down; for as the Lord was angry, ſo will he again heal, and the Church will quickly again recover its Beauty, and ſhine as it us'd; and ye ſhall ſee the Perſecuted reſettled, and Impiety again retreating into private Lurking-holes, and true Faith deliver'd boldly every-where with great Freedom: Only, take heed not to defile your ſelves with the Doctrin of the <hi>Arians;</hi> for their Doctrin is not that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but the Doctrin of <hi>Devils;</hi> for
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:192035:136"/>they are not of a right Judgment, but Barren, and Irrational, like the Brutiſhneſs of Mules.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="52">52. <q>Neither ſhould ye be Faithleſs, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt ſuch Wonders being brought about by a Man;</q> for 'tis our Saviour's Promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 16.23, 24. <hi>If ye have Faith, but as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, and ſhall ſay to this Mountain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move; it ſhall remove, and nothing ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to you.</hi> And again, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.18. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, verily, I ſay unto you, if ye ſhall ask any thing of the Father in my Name, he ſhall give it you: Ask, and ye ſhall receive.</hi> 
                     <q>'Tis he that ſaith to his Diſciples, and all that believe in Him,</q> 
                     <hi>Heal the Sick, caſt out Devils: Freely ye have received, freely do ye give. Antony</hi> did not Cure <hi>Majeſterially</hi> and <hi>Self-aſcribingly;</hi> but he made his Prayer to, and nam'd the Name of Chriſt; ſo that it was manifeſt, that it was not he himſelf, but the Lord working and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love to Men by <hi>Antony:</hi> Only <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Exerciſe</hi> was St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s; for the ſake of that he ſat on the Mount, and rejoyc'd in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Divine things.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. He was very much troubled to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſturb'd by ſo many, and when he was dragg'd to the outer Mount: For the Judges deſir'd him to come down into the outer Mount, (becauſe 'twas not poſſible for them to come into the inner Mount, becauſe of the Multitude of Clients that follow'd him) entreating him
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:192035:137"/>that they might but juſt ſee him: But he firſt refus'd to come to them. However, they tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd, and ſent ſome Perſons that were in Cuſtody to allure him to come upon their account. Being therefore neceſſitated, by Compaſſion, when he ſaw them waiting, he came to the outer Mountain. This troubleſome deſcent of his was not Uſeleſs, but very Advantageous to a great many. He did good to the Judges, by minding them to preferr Equity before every thing, and to fear God, and to know, that <hi>with what Judgment they do judge, they ſhall be judg'd.</hi> Now the Judge and others urg'd him mightily to tarry there ſome time, and diſcourſe concerning Matters relating to Salvation. But he having done Violence to himſelf, at the requeſt of the Judge, and the Neceſſitous, in coming down told them he could not tarry with them any longer, and appeas'd their Urgency with him by a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <hi>Simile:</hi> 
                     <q>As Fiſhes die upon dry Ground, ſo Monks when they converſe with you grow looſe and faint: Whereſore we muſt haſten to the Mount, as Fiſhes to the Water, leſt by tarrying without ſome time, we forget what is within.</q> The Judge having heard this, and ſuch like Sayings from him, wondred, and ſaid, <q>This Man is truly a <hi>Servant of God;</hi> for, Whence ſhould ſuch a private Perſon have ſuch and ſo great Underſtanding, unleſs he were belov'd by God?</q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:192035:137"/> 54. But there was a certain great Officer, Namely, <hi>Balacius,</hi> who bitterly Perſecuted us Chriſtians, becauſe he was bigotted for the deteſtable <hi>Arians;</hi> He was ſo cruel, that he ſtrip'd the Virgins, and ſcourg'd the <hi>Anachorets</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. So <hi>Antony</hi> writ him a Letter to this Effect; <q>I ſee Wrath coming upon thee, ceaſe to perſecute the Chriſtians, leſt it fall upon thee, and take hold of thee in an inſtant; for it will come.</q> But <hi>Balacius</hi> grinn'd, ſcornfully flung the Letter on the Ground, and ſpat upon it, and abus'd the Meſſenger, and bid him ſay to <hi>Antony,</hi> 
                     <q>Since you are ſo ſolicitous for the Monks, I will alſo give you your ſelf a Viſit.</q> And before five Days expir'd, Wrath ſeiz'd upon him; for <hi>Balacius</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> the under-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Egypt,</hi> went out together on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back to the chief Seat or Mannor of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> call'd <hi>Chaerea,</hi> (now the Horſes were <hi>Balacius</hi>'s, and the gentleſt of all that he kept) and before they came to the Place, began jocularly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partee together, as they us'd to do; and, on a ſudden, the gentler of the Two Horſes, which <hi>Neſtorius</hi> rid, bit <hi>Balacius,</hi> and fell upon him and mangled his Thigh with his Teeth; ſo he went ſtrait-way back into the City, and dy'd in Three Days time. They all admir'd to ſee <hi>Antony</hi>'s Prophecy ſo ſoon fulfill'd. This was his Way of Admoniſhing the Bitter and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate.</p>

Others that came to him he inſtructed ſo excellently, that they forgot their Law-Suits, and call'd thoſe Happy that retir'd from a popular Life. He behav'd himſelf in the caſe of the Oppreſs'd, as if he himſelf, not they were the Sufferers. He had Power enough to do good to all, inſomuch, That many Souldiers and others, who had Poſſeſſions, laid aſide the Burthens of Life, and preſently became Monks: In ſhort, He was, as it were, a Phyſician beſtow'd upon <hi>Egypt</hi> by God. What <hi>griev'd Perſon</hi> did not go back <hi>Rejoycing</hi> from him? What Perſon came to him <hi>Mourning</hi> for <hi>Deceas'd Relations,</hi> and did not lay by his <hi>Sorrow?</hi> What <hi>angry Perſon</hi> came, and was not turn'd into <hi>Love?</hi> What <hi>Poor Man,</hi> who ſaw and heard him, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe <hi>Riches,</hi> and find Conſolation in his <hi>Poverty?</hi> What <hi>Negligent Man</hi> went away from him, and was not <hi>ſtronger and more Fervent?</hi> What <hi>Youth</hi> came to the Mount and ſaw <hi>Antony,</hi> and did not preſently deny his <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and love <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety?</hi> Who came to him <hi>tempted by Devils,</hi> and was not <hi>reliev'd?</hi> Who came <hi>troubled in his Thoughts,</hi> and had not <hi>his Mind made ſerene</hi> by him? For, this was one great Benefit of <hi>Antony</hi>'s Exerciſe, namely, That, as I ſaid before, having <hi>the Gift of diſcerning of Spirits,</hi> he knew their Motions: Neither was he ignorant which way their Affection and Impetus bent. And not only he himſelf was not impos'd upon by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:192035:138"/>them; but he alſo comforted thoſe who were <hi>troubled in Mind,</hi> and inſtructed them how they might baffle their Wiles, explaining the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Subtleties of the Devils working in them. Every one therefore, as animated by him, departed, daring the Devices of the Devil and his Party. Virgins alſo who had Suiters, having only ſeen St. <hi>Antony</hi> at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, continu'd <hi>Virgins</hi> to <hi>Christ.</hi> There came alſo ſome from Foreign Parts to him, who were diſmiſs'd from him, as from a Father, with great Benefit. When he dy'd, they were all his <hi>Orphans,</hi> comforting themſelves with his bare Memory, and holding faſt his Admonitions and Inſtructions.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. And now 'tis but decent and fitting to acquaint you with the Nature of the <hi>End of his Life;</hi> for, indeed, 'twas ſuch as does deſerve Emulation.</p>
                  <p>Near his <hi>Death,</hi> he did (according to his old Cuſtom) viſit the Monks in the outer Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and being informed, by Providence, of his End, he ſpake to them thus: <q>I make this as my laſt Viſit to you, and ſhall admire if we ſhould ſee one another again in this World. 'Tis time for me now to let go my Body, for I am near an Hundred and Five Years Old.</q> At this ſaying they wept, clung about him, and ſaluted him. But he, juſt as it became one leaving a ſtrange Place for his own Countrey, rejoyc'd, <q>and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:192035:139"/>charg'd them not to be negligent in Labours, nor to faint in Exerciſe; but to live, as dying daily, and, as I ſaid before, to keep their Souls from filthy Thoughts, and to have a Zeal for the Saints; but not to go a-near the <hi>Meletian Schiſmaticks;</hi> for, ſaid he, ye know their wicked and prophane purpoſe; nor to have any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the <hi>Arians;</hi> for their Impiety is manifeſt: Neither when ye ſee their Judges in Power be ye troubled; for 'twill ceaſe, and their Opinion and Splendour is mortal, and of a ſhort ſtanding; wherefore, keep ye your ſelves pure from them, and hold the Tradition of your Fathers, and principally a pious Faith in our Lord Chriſt Jeſus, whom ye have learnt in the Holy Scriptures, and have often been put in mind of, even by me.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="57">57. When he had ſaid this, the Brethren urg'd him to tarry and die there: But that he would not, he ſhew'd by his ſilence, as for many Reaſons, ſo eſpecially for this: The <hi>Egyptians</hi> love to bury the Bodies of Zealots, and eſpecially of Martyrs, and wrap them up in fine Linnen. Now they don't bury them in the Earth, but lay them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Couches, and keep them in Repoſitories by themſelves, thinking thereby to honour the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd: But <hi>Antony</hi> often beſought the Biſhops to warn the People againſt it, and alſo reprov'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lay-Men and Women for it, ſaying, <q>That that was neither Lawful nor very Holy; for the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:192035:139"/>Bodies of the Patriarchs, to this Day, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in Sepulchres; nay, even the Body of our Lord Himſelf was laid in one, and a Stone was laid upon it,</q> and hid it till he roſe again; whereby he ſhew'd them that they tranſgreſſed the Law in not hiding the Bodies of the departed, although they be Holy; for, What is greater or more holy than our Lord's Body? Many therefore afterwards bury'd under Ground, and gave Thanks to God. Now St. <hi>Antony</hi> knowing the Cuſtom. of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and fearing leſt they ſhould do ſo by his Body, haſted his Departure, and took his Leave of the Monks in the Outer Mount, and went into the Inner Mount, where he us'd to live.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. A few Months after he fell <hi>Sick,</hi> and having call'd to thoſe that were with him, (for he had Two within with him, who had been Aſceticks with him Fifteen Years, and ſerv'd him becauſe of his extream Old Age) he ſaid to them, <q>I now (as 'tis written) go the way of my Fathers, for I ſee my ſelf call'd by my Lord; but be ye ſober, and finiſh a long-liv'd Exerciſe: Be as earneſt to hold faſt your Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as though you were juſt beginning: Ye know the Devils are plotting againſt you: Ye know they are fierce in Will, but weak in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; don't therefore be afraid of them, but breath Chriſt, and believe in Him, and live as dying every day, taking heed to your ſelves,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:192035:140"/>and remembring my Exhortations: Hold no Communion with the <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> nor the <hi>Arians;</hi> for ye know how I declin'd them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Heterodox and Chriſt-oppoſing Hereſie. Do ye ſtudy principally to cleave unto Chriſt and his Saints, that after Death they may receive you, as Friends and Acquaintance, into Everlaſting Habitations. Think upon and reliſh theſe Counſels; and if ye have any regard for me, and do remember me, as a Father, don't ſuffer any one to take my Body into <hi>Egypt,</hi> leſt they lay me in their Houſes; for for that reaſon I came hither: Ye know how I have rebuk'd thoſe who did it, and charg'd them to do ſo no more. Do ye therefore bury my Body under Ground, and mind my Words, that no Body but your ſelves may know where I am bury'd; for I ſhall receive my Body incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible from my Saviour in the Reſurrection. And pray do ye divide my Cloaths; Give one Leathern Garment to Biſhop <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and the Blanket which he gave new to me, but is now grown old; and the other Leathern Jacket to Biſhop <hi>Serapion,</hi> and take ye the Hair-Cloth and ſave it, my Children, for <hi>Antony</hi> paſſeth away, and is no longer with you.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="59">59. Having ſaid this he ſaluted them, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd his Feet, and, as it were, ſeeing Friends come unto him, and rejoycing becauſe of them, (for he look'd with a cheerful Countenance as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:192035:140"/>he lay) he left us, and was added unto the Fathers. So, in fine, the Monks wrapp'd him up, and buried him under Ground, according to his Command. And no Body, to this Day, except the Two Monks, knows where he was Bury'd. The Veſtments being diſtributed, according as he order'd, every one kept them, as a great Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; for he that ſees them does, as it were, ſee <hi>Antony;</hi> and he that puts them on, carries his Admonitions about him with Joy.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. Such was <hi>Antony</hi>'s Exerciſe, and ſuch the End of his Life in the Body: And if theſe things are ſmall, in compariſon to his Excellency, judge ye what ſort of <hi>Man of God</hi> he was, who, to ſo great an Age, from his Youth up, kept cloſe to his rigorous Diſcipline; neither conquer'd by Variety of Food, upon the Account of his Old Age; nor changing the Habit of his Raiment, for want of Vigour; or ſo much as waſhing his Feet; And yet, in all reſpects, he was ſound and unhurt; for he had his Eyes clear, ſeeing very well; not one of his Teeth was loſt, only near the Gums they were worn, becauſe of his great Age: He was alſo ſound in his Hands and Feet, and much clearer in every part than thoſe who uſe ſeveral <hi>Diets, Bathings,</hi> and <hi>Variety of Garments;</hi> and as to Strength too, they were much more ready.</p>
                  <p n="61">61. St. <hi>Antony</hi> liv'd and dy'd admir'd and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by all every where, and long'd for by thoſe who never ſaw him: A great Sign of his
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:192035:141"/>Vertue, and of a Soul that truly lov'd God; for he did not get his Learning by Books, nor external Wiſdom, nor any Art: But <hi>Antony</hi> was renown'd purely for his <hi>Devotion to God.</hi> No one can deny that this was the <hi>Gift of God.</hi> How came he who was hid, and ſat in a Mountain, to be heard of in <hi>Spain, France, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> unleſs God had made his Name known every where, who promis'd this to <hi>Antony</hi> at firſt; for although ſuch Heroes act ſecretly, and are willing to lye conceal'd, yet the Lord ſhews them, as Lamps to all, that they may know that his Commands, which he has given to reform us, are practicable, and thence may derive a Zeal for the ways of Vertue.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. Read ye this to others, that they may know what ſort of Life the Life of <hi>Monks</hi> ſhould be, and may be perſwaded, that our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt will glorifie thoſe who glorifie Him, and ſerve Him unto the End; not only bringing them to the Kingdom of Heaven, but making them, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they hide and retire, celebrated here for their Vertue, to the Benefit of others. And, if there be a Neceſſity, read it to the Heathens, that they may know not only that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Son of God;</hi> but that thoſe Chriſtians who ſerve Him truly, and believe in Him piouſly, reprove thoſe <hi>Spirits</hi> whom they account <hi>Gods,</hi> and tread upon them, and chaſe them, as thoſe who are the <hi>Deceivers</hi> and <hi>Corrupters</hi> of Men; and this they do by the Grace and Strength of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord; <hi>to whom be Glory for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>latter of theſe Diſcourſes</hi> was <hi>Printed</hi> as part of a <hi>Preface</hi> to that Book of Sr. <hi>Matthew Hale</hi>'s, from whence the beginning of the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> is now taken; but why it was <hi>not Publiſhed</hi> with it, I know no reaſon, unleſs that, which is the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Obſtacle to all Good, that Satan hindered it. And that, I make no queſtion, was the principal moving Cauſe, which ſet the others on work. That wicked, envious Spirit, who had raiſed up all the Evil he could, both against him, and against me, in our ſeveral Families in his Life-time, hath not ceaſed to do ſo ſtill ſince his Death. By what he got ſuch Advantage against my ſelf, I know very well, and intend to declare it. But by what he got ſuch Advantage against that good Man, is a Secret I know nothing of. But this I know, that he hath been <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy in his Family, both in his Life-time, and ſince his Death, and particularly in what I am now ſaying. I long looked upon
<pb facs="tcp:192035:144"/>him as a Man raiſed up by the Special Providence of God to be an Illuſtrious Example of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> in this degenerate Age: And therefore, that People might not be deprived of the Benefit of ſuch an Example by their Ignorance of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, (as I found by Experience many were) I did in his Life-time publiſh a Volume of his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations,</hi> even after I had earneſtly preſſed him to conſent to it, and he refuſed: Indeed, I knew him, and he knew me, ſo well, that I did not fear any miſconſtruction from him: and after his Death, I deſired to have done Honour to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory for the ſame purpoſe, by the Publication of ſuch of his <hi>Writings,</hi> as were most neceſſary and ſeaſonable, that the Benefit of his <hi>Labours,</hi> as well as of his <hi>Example,</hi> while yet freſh in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, might be communicated, as much as might be, to all, and they might mutually recommend each other for the greater Benefit of all. But, alas! that wicked Spirit, which had ſo prevailed in his Family in his Life-time, as made him tell ſome of them, <hi>That Satan, or the Devil, did ride them, as an Ape would do a Maſtiff-Dog,</hi> hath likewiſe prevailed hitherto upon ſuch as vainly gloried in their Relation to him, to obſtruct that good Deſign for Twenty years together, without due regard either to that Service of God, thoſe Benefits to Men, the true Honour of his Memory, (in which they vainly gloried) or the Performance of his Will according to his Mind. For though he had
<pb facs="tcp:192035:144"/>not expreſsly ordered the <hi>Publication</hi> of one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in particular; yet had he made this Proviſion in a Codicil concerning the Publication of any of them, that he had nominated the <hi>Bookſeller,</hi> who ſhould have the <hi>Printing</hi> of them, paying as much as another would in reaſon for them: and of the Profits, appointed one part to one, for his Care and Pains in overſeeing and ordering the Publication; another part to another, for Writing and Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the rest, among his Servants; and told them what he had done for them: ſo that beſides the Injury done to their <hi>Country,</hi> they have done a double Injury to his <hi>Memory,</hi> not only by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Honour due to it, but by Diſhonouring it, and giving occaſion to a Blemiſh and Reproach to it, provoking ſome not only to think, but to ſpeak hardly of him, as if he had abuſed them in ſome of the last Acts of his Life: and all this out of a ſordid Humour to get or keep what he had otherwiſe diſpoſed of. And though thus they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed their Malice and Spight against the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Good Man, yet was not this the chief part of their Work and Triumph, that they had raiſed this Injury againſt his Memory, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, had deprived his Country of the Benefit of much of his Labours in his own Profeſſion: But there is a greater matter in the bottom, and of greater concern to them, which theſe Wicked, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Agents had a principal regard to. The Good Man had taken great Pains in examining and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb facs="tcp:192035:145"/>the Grounds and Evidences of <hi>Religion,</hi> both <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Revealed:</hi> And he was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well qualified for it, both by Natural Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, by Exerciſe of his Parts in his own Profeſſion, (which affords as much and good Exerciſe for ſuch a purpoſe as any) and by Freedom from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, either of Education or of Temporal Intereſt. For though he had a Religious Education, yet it is certain, that after he came to maturity of Thinking and Judging, he became, as he found reaſon, in many things, of a different Judgment from the Notions and Sentiments he had first received; by which it appeared, that his <hi>Religion</hi> was the Religion of his Judgment, and not of his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And being no Eccleſiaſtick, but a Man of a Civil Employment, he ſtood fair to be looked upon as an Indifferent Judge, and not as an Advocate or Party, (as Clergy-men generally are reputed by ſome) and, by conſequence, his Writings upon ſuch Subjects, beſides the weight of his Reaſon, would have a double Weight of Authority, (if we take in his Example too) above others, to make them ſucceſsful upon ſuch as have received pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice from the Scandalous Practices of too many Profeſſors and Preachers of the Chriſtian Religion; which hath been a <hi>principal Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> heretofore, and of <hi>Deiſm</hi> at preſent, and of the <hi>Contempt of the Clergy,</hi> and more effectual and prevalent than any of thoſe which have been aſſigned in Print; though by <hi>Scandalous,</hi> I intend
<pb facs="tcp:192035:145"/>here nothing but Zeal for Preferments, and a cold Indifferency in Matters of Religion. For as it hath been rightly obſerved, <hi>When Vertue fails in the Prieſts, Faith will fail in the People;</hi> be their Preaching what it will. Now, by how much greater was the Advantage that the Writings of this Man had above others, to have done Service in this Cauſe, ſo much the greater was the Gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which theſe Wicked Spirits received in the Suppreſſion of them.</p>
                  <p>I know nothing ſo ſordid that ever appeared in his Life. But that this hath been ordered by the Malice and Subtilty of thoſe Wicked Spirits, who had gotten Advantage against Him, or his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; (however ſome particular Diſpoſitions in Perſons might make it more feaſible) as I verily believe, ſo I am well ſatisfied, he would not at all have doubted, had he been living, and to have ſpoken his Judgment in a like Caſe. He and I both, before he died, had had Experience enough to ſatisfie us concerning ſuch matters. And I wiſh his, and all other Families, who are fallen into any ſuch Snare, may conſider well of it, and be well adviſed how to recover themſelves out of it, if it may be. Many ſuch have I known, and though the Burden be ſealed upon ſome, and the Decree fixed, yet in others there ſeemed to be a Door open, if Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity was not neglected. Mens Belief or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief will not alter the Truth of things: But Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of things that are true is often the Cauſe of
<pb facs="tcp:192035:146"/>great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappineſs: and they who disbelieve ſuch things as theſe, are not the leſs obnoxious to their Malice, but more ſecure in their Power. So much as this is not impertinent to be ſaid concerning the Malice and Subtlety of the <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of the Gracious Conduct of the <hi>Good.</hi> And I think my ſelf ſpecially obliged to declare my Sentiments of both, upon any juſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. And, indeed,</p>
                  <p>I confeſs the <hi>Preface</hi> was not written ſo much for the ſake of the <hi>Book,</hi> as the <hi>Book</hi> Publiſhed for the ſake of the <hi>Preface,</hi> as an Occaſion to write on that Subject, which I thought my ſelf obliged to do, as an Act of Penitence for an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy Miſcarriage, whereby my Enemy got that Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt me, which I mentioned before, and ſhall here repeat in the Words then Printed, as followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I muſt not here forbear upon this Occaſion to add, not my Opinion, but my own certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, upon great, and long, and in ſome reſpects in a great meaſure woful Experience, in an Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confeſſion of my Fault, to give Glory to God, Teſtimony to his Truth, and Warning to Men. I have had Experience of this <hi>Divine Conduct,</hi> and of the <hi>Bleſſings and Curſes</hi> attending Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Diſobedience to it; ſo that I have plainly perceived that the Conduct of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> through the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into the Promiſed Land, was a viſible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
<pb facs="tcp:192035:146"/>or Repreſentation of the Secret Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Conduct of Souls out of Slavery under the Powers of Darkneſs, through the Wilderneſs of this World, into the Land of Rest: and the very ſame thing in Action and Repreſentation, which is delivered by way of Doctrine and Admonition in the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus, iv. 11,—20.</hi> and <hi>vi. 18,—31.</hi> The Croſſes, Diſappointments, and <hi>Afflictions,</hi> which I have gone through, have been very grievous, and many of them known to the World, though nothing hath appeared in my Life, to which they could be imputed by others as a Cauſe in any reſpect. I must therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that while I did act in a ready Compliance with that Conduct, I not only had great Peace and Serenity of Mind, but all things went ſtrangely proſperous and ſucceſsful with me; and I had extraordinary Anſwers to my Prayers, not only for my ſelf, but for others alſo: But whenever I have done contrary, I always had trouble in my Mind, and what I did, was either blaſted, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful, and often of ſuch evil Conſequence, as I did not foreſee. This I have found ſo, by great and long <hi>Experience,</hi> and in ſome of the great Buſineſſes of my Life, wherein I acted not only upon my own Reaſon and Judgment, but alſo upon the Advice and Perſuaſions of very conſiderable Perſons. And after conſiderable Experience of this, I was once ſo unhappy in my Diſobedience to this Conduct, upon a ſpecial Occaſion, having none
<pb facs="tcp:192035:147"/>to adviſe with, and yielding too much to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of our <hi>Anti-enthuſiaſts,</hi> which was a Temptation to me, that (as I have ſpecial reaſon to believe) it was like the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> to me, an Inlet unto all the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappineſs that hath ſince befallen me and my Family: And I have been as it were turned back into the Wilderneſs ever ſince. The Things wherein I had this Conduct were not matter of Duty in themſelves, or not in the particular Circumſtances; but either were ſuch as were in Humane appearance ſo indifferent, that I might have uſed my Liberty, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was much different from the Wiſdom of the World. And though I cannot ſay whether the Afflictions I have ſuffer'd were ſo ordered as a <hi>Puniſhment</hi> for my Miſcarriage, yet I am aſſur'd they were a <hi>Conſequence</hi> thereof, at least ſuch as we often fall into, when we neglect the Good Counſel of our Friends. And they have been ſuch, as I am perſuaded it is my Duty upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make this publick Penitential Confeſſion, whatever Prejudice I may ſuffer thereby from Men: If I can but thereby obtain the Favour of God, and benefit Men, I ſhall accept that as part of my Puniſhment.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>For the <hi>Certainty</hi> of this, I can truly affirm, That I had immediately upon my Miſcarriage as ſenſible <hi>Notice of the Evils</hi> which have ſince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen me, as I can have of any thing by any ſenſe I have; as plain as if a Sentence had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb facs="tcp:192035:147"/>against me. And what I have ſuffered, hath had Two ſeveral <hi>Marks</hi> as exactly agreeable to my Miſcarriage, as the print of a Seal upon the Wax to the Seal it ſelf. I cannot ſay but <hi>other Sins or Miſcarriages</hi> might be <hi>Ingredients</hi> in this Caſe: but I know full well that this was the <hi>Inlet</hi> unto all thoſe Evils, which I am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd had been prevented, had I continued at that time in the way I was in. And it often recalls to my mind part of the Eighty first Pſalm, and other Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which have been fulfilled in my Caſe; and therefore I have great reaſon upon ſuch an Occaſion to confeſs my Fault, that I may have other more comfortable Paſſages made good to me hereafter.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And here I cannot but remember, that I ſcarce knew the Man at that time <hi>to confult</hi> with in theſe things, who was not more likely to have put me out of the way, than to have directed me aright, how to proceed in it. And this I note for the ſake of ſuch <hi>Spiritual Guides</hi> as are conſulted in ſuch Caſes: If they be not very careful and conſiderate to avoid the Common Errors on both ſides, and neither incourage nor diſcourage the Attendance to ſuch Impulſes and Impreſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in general, but carefully endeavour to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh and to direct aright, they may bring great Trouble upon thoſe who conſult them, (as I have known ſome do;) and perhaps greater upon themſelves, when they are call'd to give
<pb facs="tcp:192035:148"/>Account of their Stewardſhip, either here or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far was printed before: to which I muſt now add: Whether theſe things (as perhaps ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) were not permitted to befall me for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to others, I know not: but this I know by <hi>Experience in others,</hi> and even while this is Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there is great need of <hi>Good Admonition.</hi> For I find, by divers ſuch <hi>Experiences,</hi> that God is pleaſed at this time to give ſome ſenſible <hi>Notices</hi> of his Conduct to many, who are in ſome ſort in the Caſe of <hi>Samuel, 1</hi> Sam. <hi>3.7.</hi> who then <hi>did not know the Lord, neither was the Word of the Lord yet revealed to him;</hi> and when they come to the Priest, who ſhould be as <hi>Eli</hi> to them, to direct them how to behave themſelves, are by him put quite out of the Way, and either diſmiſſed to the Phyſician, to be cured of Melancholy; or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to ſome cheerful innocent Converſation; or to mind their Buſineſs in their Callings; or to reject the Impreſſions they feel as Fancies, and vain Fears and Scruples. And many Caſes there are, wherein ſome of theſe Directions might be proper; but there are many others, wherein they are all quite out of the Way; and wherein great <hi>Faults</hi> have been, to my knowledge, and, I doubt, are daily committed by Learned, and otherwiſe able and good Men; partly through Ignorance in theſe Matters, or common Prejudice against them; partly for fear of incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging what they ſee many abuſe to their own hurt,
<pb facs="tcp:192035:148"/>and to the Scandal of others; and partly for fear of bringing upon themſelves the Cenſure and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of inclination to Fanaticiſm or Enthuſiaſm; and thereby at once the Grace and ſpecial Favour of God is rejected, the poor Soul greatly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, at least, if no worſe happen to it; and the Director must be accountable for both.</p>
                  <p>But to make a matter of ſo great Importance the more plain, it may not be amiſs to propoſe an inſtance or two of ſome <hi>Caſes:</hi> A Perſon wants an <hi>Employment,</hi> and an Employment is offered; but the Perſon hath ſtrong Impreſſions, either not to accept it, or not to continue it, being otherwiſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed for the preſent; and thereupon repairs to ſome noted Divine for Advice: The Divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that the Perſon needs an Employment, and upon Examination can diſcover nothing unlawful in the Employment, nor unfit for the Perſon; and thereupon confidently adviſeth to reject the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and embrace and continue the Employment. Such Advice as this proves, in the event, to one, unſucceſsful all his time; to another, his Ruine and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoing as to his Temporal Eſtate; to another, the Occaſion of the Loſs of his Life; and to another, the hazard, if not loſs, of his Soul; and all this by ſuch Means and Occaſions as could not be foreſeen or diſcovered by any Mortal; but are plainly ſeen and foreſeen by ſome kind inviſible Friends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for us.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:192035:149"/>
                  <p> Again, a <hi>young Woman,</hi> who is not at all proud, if we will believe her, only ſhe deſires to be like other-Folks; but ſhe finds ſomething within her that tells her, or ſuggeſts, that ſhe'll be damned if ſhe wear ſuch a Dreſs. Hereupon ſhe goes for Advice to a Divine. He being more cautious in ſuch caſes, tells her, that ſince ſhe may both lawfully and decently wear another meaner or plainer, ſhe ſhould have a care that ſhe doth not reject ſuch Motions in her Mind: For many times things which are not damnable Sins in themſelves, may be Occaſions and Inlets to ſuch as are, and Hindrances of Graces, and ſo produce ſuch unhappy conſequence at laſt. But not liking this Advice, away ſhe goes to another of greater note; and he tells her, that ſince that Dreſs is not unlawful, it cannot be a Damnable Sin to wear it; and therefore whatever it was, it could not be the Spirit of God that did ſo fright her; but ſhe muſt have a care of ſuch things, leſt ſhe run into Fanaticiſm, and I know not what. And this ſhe likes and follows till the tricking up of her Natural Beauty proves a Snare to her ſelf and others; the kind Impreſſions, which ſhe formerly had upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ceaſe; her Devotion grows cool, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſeth again into the common Courſe of the World, and what will be the end of it, God knows.</p>
                  <p>What I have had experience of in my ſelf and my own Family, partly for want of due regard to ſuch Notices, and too much yielding to Motives of Moral Prudence; and partly by ſuch unhappy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
<pb facs="tcp:192035:149"/>of Caſes by others, would be too long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late particularly. I have had no leſs than <hi>four Sons</hi> undone in this City, all as likely Youths as any, and all, after their diſappointments, by their Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gaining the Favour and Kindneſs of all they converſed with: and in the placing of them ſpared neither Coſt, nor Pains, nor Care, and took the beſt Advice I could have; at firſt made choice of ſuch for Maſters, as I expected to act upon Principles of Religion; afterward, ſuch as I expected Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, at leaſt Moral Honeſty and Humanity from them; but was diſappointed in all. And I know aſſuredly that all did proceed from ſuch Cauſes as I have in general mentioned already; and had notice of it in general before.</p>
                  <p>It is a great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappineſs to this Church and Nation at this time, that we have ſo few of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Experience in theſe things, eſpecially among thoſe, who ſhould be Guides to others. And it is their Great Sin, and, without due Repentance, will prove Damnation to many, that they have been ſo bug-beared by a fluttering, Sadducean, Atheiſtical Humour, and baſe prudential Compliance of ſome of greater Name than genuine Chriſtian Vertue, as to be aſhamed or afraid to aſſert, or own ſo great and noble a Principle of the Religion they profeſs. And therefore, beſides my own ſpecial Obligations, and concern for the Honour and Service of God, and of our Holy Religion, Pity to the many Souls, which I perceive deſtitute of true Spiritual Direction, and
<pb facs="tcp:192035:150"/>Indignation at the Baſeneſs, Folly and Madneſs of ſo many Prudentialiſts amongst us, hath made me for ſome time to long for an Opportunity to bear my Teſtimony in the Caſe. The Motive in my collecting <hi>the other Diſcourſe,</hi> (which, though written laſt, and by the by, according to its proper order, is here firſt) was to detect a Miſapplication of Truth, and retort his Argument againſt himſelf, who had ſo groſsly and rudely treated the Buſineſs of Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, without due regard to that Sacred Principle of Religion, which is pretended in it; or to the moſt noble and heroick Profeſſors and Obſervers of it. But in this degenerate Age God hath not left himſelf without Witneſs, but raiſed up ſome of a more generous Spirit; ſuch as Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the late profound Dr. <hi>Cradoc,</hi> whom I much eſteemed for his Generoſity, as well as Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in Preaching up this Doctrine, who told me, he had Preached <hi>20</hi> or <hi>30</hi> Sermons upon it; and that if we deny that, we may burn our Bibles; for he knew not (he ſaid) what Religion would ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie without it; and the Learned Mr. <hi>Matthew Scrivener,</hi> who hath left us a Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Myſtical Divinity,</hi> Intituled, <hi>The Method and Means to a true Spiritual Life,</hi> and others; to ſay nothing of ſome I know now Living, whoſe number I pray God increaſe, and make them perfect and compleat in all Graces and Vertue, to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory, and the Happineſs of this Church and Nation.</p>

                  <head>OF THE Antiquity, Tradition, <hi>and</hi> Succeſſion, of Myſtical Divinity Among the GENTILES, FROM THE Teſtimony <hi>&amp;</hi> Confeſſion OF AN Eminent Adverſary.</head>
                  <p>AS <hi>Adam</hi> was the common Parent of all Man-kind from the Creation, ſo was <hi>Noah</hi> the common Parent of all Man-kind who have lived ſince the Flood. And of <hi>Noah</hi> it is recorded, that he <hi>was a just Man, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in his Generations,</hi> and that he <hi>walked with God,</hi> Gen. 6.9. And that he was 600 years Old when the Flood of Waters was upon the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:192035:151"/>Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.6. From whence we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably believe that he could not but be well acquainted with all the Knowledge of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. And what this <hi>Walking with God</hi> doth imply, we may underſtand from the reſt of the Hiſtory, and the Apoſtles Obſervation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>viz.</hi> not only a careful Obſervance of all the General Rules of Righteouſneſs tranſmitted from <hi>Adam</hi> to his Poſterity, but a ready Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Conformity to all ſpecial Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Manifeſtations of the Will of God to him. Inſtances of which are thoſe Commands of God, and his Obedience thereunto; in <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ark,</hi> which undoubtedly expoſed him to much trouble, by Queſtions concerning it, and to various Cenſures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.14, 22. He <hi>did,</hi> notwithſtanding, <hi>according to all that God commanded him, ſo did he;</hi> and in <hi>going into it</hi> with the ſeveral ſorts of Creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.1, 5, 7, 9. and in <hi>going out again</hi> at the Command of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.16, 18. In his Walking with God in this manner, he could not but, beſides all the <hi>Knowledge</hi> which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from his Anceſtors, learn much more by the immediate Teachings of God. And it is not to be queſtioned, but, as he was inſtructed by his Anceſtors, ſo he was careful to inſtruct his Family &amp; Poſterity in all neceſſary Knowledge; amongſt which, that of <hi>Walking with God</hi> was ſome of the chief. And this being ſo, I ſee no reaſon,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:192035:151"/>Why other Nations ſhould not have derived their Knowledge, with their Deſcent, directly from <hi>Noah?</hi> or, Why we ſhould ſuppoſe the other Branches of his Poſterity to have all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Knowledge, of Divine and Sacred things eſpecially, collaterally from that of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> rather than directly and lineally from their common Anceſtor <hi>Noah.</hi> As <hi>Noah</hi> offered Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.20. and <hi>Abraham</hi> offered Sacrifice; ſo we find <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> among other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Such was <hi>MELCHIZEDECK,</hi> a Prieſt of the moſt High God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it was by Revelation from God, or ſome Divine Means, that <hi>PHARAOH</hi> underſtood that it was becauſe of <hi>Sarah, Abraham</hi>'s Wife, that the Lord plagued him and his Houſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.17. as we find it expreſſed afterward in the like Caſe of <hi>ABIMELECH, Gen.</hi> 20.3, 6. <hi>God came to Abimelech in a Dream by Night, and ſaid to him, Behold, thou art but a dead Man, for the Woman which thou haſt taken: for ſhe is a Man's Wife.</hi> And another <hi>PHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAOH</hi> acknowledged <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be a Man, in whom was the Spirit of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.38. and when he raiſed him to the greateſt Preferment in the Kingdom, gave him for a Wife the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an <hi>Egyptian Prieſt,</hi> ibid. <hi>v.</hi> 45. And <hi>Moſes</hi> Married the Daughter of a <hi>Prieſt of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, JETHRO,</hi> Ex. 2.16, 21. who was a good Man, and a Worſhipper of the true God,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:192035:152"/>as appears, <hi>Ex.</hi> 18.9, 10, 12. And the Means then <hi>to Inquire of the Lord</hi> were common to them, and to other Nations: As <hi>REBEKAH, Gen.</hi> 25.22. So <hi>BALAAM, Numb.</hi> 22.8, 9, 18, 19, 20: 23.4. went to inquire of the Lord, and received An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers from Him. And about this time <hi>JOB</hi> is believed to have lived, who was a Holy Man, and offered Sacrifices, and had Viſions.</p>
                  <p>By theſe Inſtances, and others that might be noted, we may underſtand, that in thoſe ancient times it was believed, in all Nations, that there were <hi>Means,</hi> whereby Men and Women might come <hi>to have</hi> ſome <hi>Acquaintance and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with God;</hi> and what theſe Means were, is well worth our Inquiry.</p>
                  <p>That the JEWS had anciently their Schools or <hi>Colleges of Prophets,</hi> we may obſerve in the Sacred Scriptures. And though what were their <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> and their <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> there preſcribed, is not in the Scripture particularly related; yet in the Particulars men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned they ſeem to have been much the ſame with what was practiſed by the Ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Anchorets</hi> and <hi>Coenobites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we inquire amongſt <hi>other Nations</hi> of moſt ancient Note and Fame for Knowledge in Divine matters, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> are the moſt conſiderable. And the Means recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by them do ſo well agree with the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Divinity</hi> delivered by divers Chriſtians,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:192035:152"/>that ſome Oppoſers of this Divinity think they have ſufficient ground to derive it from them; and ſuppoſing that a Prejudice to it, have taken the pains to do it. <q>If the CHALDAICK ORACLES (ſaith one of conſiderable Learning, Name, and Place) were ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, which were frequently quoted by <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus, Jamblicus, Porphyrius,</hi> and <hi>Proclus,</hi> (who did wholly approve the <hi>Chaldaick Theology;</hi> and from them in a great meaſure the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were preſerved) we might more fully manifeſt theſe things; yet as they are, they give us ſufficient ground to draw the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of this Myſtical Divinity from thence. For they ſpeak of <hi>God's being united to the Soul, by the Soul's claſping God to herſelf;</hi> and that <hi>not by any act of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> but <hi>by the Flower of the Mind;</hi> (the very Phraſe uſed by <hi>Proclus,</hi> and the ſame which the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks call, the <hi>Fund of the Spirit;</hi>) <hi>of the Soul's being inebriated from God,</hi> (which <hi>Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> calls, <hi>being drunk with the Divine Nectar</hi>) and <hi>Pſellus</hi> explains, of <hi>Divine Illuminations and Extaſies;</hi> of <hi>Abſtraction from the Body,</hi> and <hi>extending the Mind upwards,</hi> and <hi>haſtening to the Divine Light and the Beams of the Father;</hi> with ſeveral other paſſages to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the EGYPTIANS, the ſame Author tells us, <q>That <hi>Jamblicus,</hi> in his Book
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:192035:153"/>of <hi>the Egyptian Myſteries,</hi> (which he writ in anſwer to an Epiſtle of <hi>Porphyry</hi> to an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſt, and wherein <hi>Proclus</hi> ſaith that he writ like a Man inſpir'd) diſcourſes at large concerning <hi>Divine Extaſies,</hi> and <hi>Viſions,</hi> and <hi>Inſpirations;</hi> in which he deſcribes the Perſons juſt after the Myſtical way, as <hi>no longer leading a humane Life,</hi> or <hi>having any Operations of their Senſes or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, but their Mind and Soul is only in the Divine Power, and not in their own, being acted and poſſeſſed wholly by it.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he ſets down the ſeveral <hi>Degrees</hi> and <hi>Kinds</hi> of thoſe; in ſome, they have only <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation;</hi> in others, near <hi>Communion;</hi> and in the higheſt of all, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> In ſome of theſe, he ſaith, <hi>the Body wholly reſts, and ſometimes breaks out into Singing, and all expreſſions of Joy: ſometimes the Body is raiſed up from the Ground,</hi> (as M. <hi>Tereſa</hi> thought hers) <hi>ſometimes it ſwells into a greater bulk, and ſometimes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi> Then he lays down <hi>Rules</hi> to know Divine Inſpirations by: <hi>viz.</hi> by Enquiring, <hi>In what manner God appears? Whether an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Fire come before Him? Whether he fills up and acts the whole Soul, ſo that there is a Ceſſation of all its own Acts?</hi> For this he makes the main Character of a Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that <hi>the Perſons are wholly taken up and poſſeſſed by the Deity; from whence follows an Extaſie and alienation of the Senſes: But if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192035:153"/>either the Soul acts, or the Body moves, then,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>it may be a falſe Inſpiration.</hi> No Man can expreſs himſelf more emphatically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the Excellency of Contemplative Prayer</hi> than <hi>Jamblicus</hi> doth: <hi>This quickens the Mind, inlargeth its Capacity, opens the Secrets of the Divinity, and fits it for Conjunction and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with God; and never leaves Men till it hath carried them to a State of Perfection; and by degrees doth alter and change Men, that it makes them put off Humane Nature, and bring them into ſuch a State of Dei-formity, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Gods. The first degree of Prayer,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>brings to a State of Recollection, and hath ſome Divine Contact, which helps our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: The ſecond carries the Soul to a nearer Communion with God, and excites the Divine Bounty to freer Communications to it: But the third is the Seal of the ineffable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, which makes our Mind &amp; Soul to reſt in God, as a Divine Port or Haven.</hi> And he concludes his Book with ſaying, <hi>That this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with God is Man's greateſt Perfection, and the End of all Religion among the</hi> Egyptians; whoſe Myſteries his Deſign was to explain and vindicate. Many other Paſſages might be produced out of him, concerning <hi>the Knowing of God by Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, and the Inſufficiency of any Act of the Mind for this ineffable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion:</hi> but theſe are enough to ſhew how well acquainted <hi>Jamblicus</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:192035:154"/>and (if we believe him) the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were with the profoundeſt Secrets of <hi>Myſtical Divinity.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a Book tranſlated out of <hi>Arabick,</hi> intituled, <hi>Of Divine Wiſdom according to the</hi> Egyptians, wherein are many things to this purpoſe; but our Author takes notice but of one paſſage in it, which he ſets down as the Words of <hi>Plato.</hi> But before we come to <hi>Plato,</hi> it is fit to be noted, that PYTHAGORAS and the PYTHAGORIANS could not but be well acquainted with this Myſtical Theology, though they did not ordinarily deliver it in ſuch expreſs terms; but in a more occult manner. For it is known &amp; confeſſed, <q>That <hi>Pythagoras</hi> himſelf was from his Youth greatly inclin'd to an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition into Religious Rites and Myſteries: That he travelled into <hi>Egypt</hi> to hear their Prieſts, was there 22 Years, had recommendations from the King to the Prieſts, and was permitted to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint himſelf with all their Learning; entred into the <hi>Egyptian Adyta,</hi> and was inſtituted in things unexpreſſible touching the Gods; gave himſelf exact Information concerning Perſons and Things, not omitting any Perſon eminent at any time for Learning, or any kind of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Rites; or any Place, where he conceived he might find ſomewhat extraordinary: That he went thence to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and continued there
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:192035:154"/>12 Years, converſed with the moſt Eminent of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> as alſo with the <hi>Perſian Magi,</hi> who entertained him very courteouſly, &amp; gave him inſight into their more hidden Myſteries, and Religious Rites; and, without doubt, with the moſt Eminent for Knowledge of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in both places; and likely enough, as <hi>Selden</hi> and others think, with <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in particular.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That he made <hi>Theology,</hi> or the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, the Firſt moſt Univerſal Being, the Centre of all his Philoſophy: That he was by way of Eminency call'd, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; and his Philoſophy, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; becauſe he treated chiefly of God, his Nature and Worſhip: That he was a great Devoto, or Advocate for God, his Worſhip, and Sacred Inſtitutes: That the Confederation of his <hi>Coenobium</hi> (for ſo they called it) or College, had reference to ſome Divine Temperament, and to Union with God, and to Unity with the Divine Soul: That the Inſtitutions of <hi>his Society</hi> and Sect, for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Probation of Diſciples, diſtinction of Perſons, Reverence to their Elders, Celibacie, Communion of Goods, Retirement from the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were very much the ſame with thoſe of the <hi>Eſſeans,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian Coenobites</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: That of the differing Sects afterward none did Pythagorize more than <hi>Plato,</hi> eſpecially in Divine matters, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Laertius</hi> have obſerved: yea, that the choiceſt of his Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſick
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:192035:155"/>Contemplations ſeem to be traduced from <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and his Followers: and that <hi>Plotinus</hi> did more clearly explicate the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the <hi>Pythagorick</hi> Philoſophy, as well as of the <hi>Platonick.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And from all this put together, we may very reaſonably conclude, eſpecially if we take in what is related by <hi>Jamblicus,</hi> That he continued 3 days and 2 nights, at one time, in the ſame Poſture, without taking either Meat, or Drink, or Sleep, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. That he muſt have been well acquainted with this Myſtick Theology, which was in ſuch Eſteem with both; thoſe, from whom he recieved Inſtructions; and thoſe, who received from him: and that in <hi>Plotinus</hi> and others, we read the <hi>Pythagorick</hi> as well as <hi>Platonick</hi> Principles; and that in both was a mixture of the <hi>Judaick,</hi> and what was derived by all from the Common Parent <hi>Noah.</hi> To this I will add only a Paſſage or two of his, out of <hi>Demophilus:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Being born of God, and rooted in Him, let us cleave to our Root.

                     <hi>It cannot by any means be, that one and the ſame Perſon ſhould apply himſelf to Pleaſures, to the Body, to the getting of Riches, and alſo to God.</hi> And is not this alſo the very Doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; <hi>Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon?</hi> But he goes on: <hi>For he who is given to Pleaſures, the ſame will alſo be careful for the Body; but he who is careful for the Body, he will alſo ſtudy to get Riches; and he, who ſtudies to get Riches, will neceſſarily be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt: But he who is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njust, is both impious toward God, and unjust toward Men: and therefore, although he ſacrifice (whole) Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombs, he is (but) the more impious, and far from God and all Religion, and deliberately Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious: Wherefore it behoveth to avoid every voluptuary Perſon, as impious and ſacrilegious,</hi> p. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You cannot well ſay that he is a happy Man, who relies upon Friends, or Children, or any tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and fading thing; for all theſe are inſtable things: But to rely upon ones ſelf and upon God, that only is firm and ſtable,</hi> p. 12.</p>

                  <p>The ſame which I have ſaid of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:192035:156"/>may in effect be ſaid of <hi>SOCRATES</hi> alſo, both as to the Diſpoſition of his Mind, as to his Travels for acquiring of Knowledge, and as to his Principles, from the Obſervations and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of ſuch as were no Friends to <hi>Myſtick Theology:</hi> They were Scholars in the ſame Schools, and received the Tradition of the ſame Doctrine, as did <hi>Plato</hi> alſo from thence, and from them; ſo that I may diſpatch this in a few Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of what is known and confeſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That he had as clear Notions as any touching God, his Nature, Unity, and other Sacred My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, which he could never have attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but by ſome borrowed Tradition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That he aſſerted, That <hi>Virtue</hi> is neither by Nature, nor by Teaching, but by Divine Inſpiration: and that all true <hi>Knowledge of God</hi> comes by Divine Infuſion; and called God his Tutor: That while Man is ſubject to, and under the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Corporal Images, ſenſible Forms, and terrene Affections, he is not rightly diſpoſed for <hi>Divine Contemplation,</hi> which requires a Mind defecated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That Divine things and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries cannot be comprehended but by a refined Judgment, by ſuch as have their Souls abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all Corporal Images, Impreſſions and Affections; and therefore Men ſhould be very intent on getting a Reformed Life, that the Mind being exonerated of its depreſſing Luſts, might,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:192035:156"/>by a natural Vigour, lift up it ſelf to Eternals, and by that Purity of Intelligence, contemplate the Nature of that Eternal Incommunicable Light, where the Cauſes of all created Natures live in Stability, <hi>v. Aug. de Civ. Dei, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 3. And as to his own Life, That he inſtituted his whole Life, even from his Childhood, by the aſſiſtance of his Divine Inſpiration, which he called a <hi>Daemon,</hi> a Voice, a Sign. And that <hi>Plato</hi> reports of him that he ſtood a whole day without any alteration in the ſame poſture, his Mind being abſtracted with pure Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that <hi>Favorinus</hi> in <hi>A. Gellius</hi> ſaith that he did this often.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now to return to our principal Author, and the Words of <hi>PLATO</hi> in him, which are theſe: <q>
                        <hi>Being often in the Depth of Contemplation, my Body being left behind, I ſeemed to enjoy the Chief Good with incredible pleaſure. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſtood as it were aſtoniſhed, finding my ſelf to be a part of the upper World, and to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Immortality, with the clearest Light; which cannot be expreſſed with Words, nor heard with Ears, nor underſtood by the Thoughts of Men:</hi> and then he deſcribes <hi>the Sadneſs he felt at the decay of that glorious Light, and the pleaſure which returned with his former Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</hi> The Words are: <hi>At last my Intellect being wearied with this Contemplation fell back into phantaſie, and then that Light failing I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:192035:157"/>ſomewhat ſad: But again having left my Body, returning thither again, I perceived my Mind abounding with Light, and that flowing then into the Body then raiſed above it.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor of <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf doth our Author take any more notice then of that one paſſage; but of <hi>the later Platoniſts, Plotinus, Jamblicus, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrygius,</hi> and <hi>Proclus,</hi> who, as he ſaith out of <hi>Pſellus,</hi> did wholly approve of the <hi>Chaldaick Theology:</hi> he gives us ſome larger Taſts; and particularly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The ſhort account of <hi>Plotinus his Hypotheſis,</hi> is this; <hi>That the Soul of Man being immerſed in the Body ſuffers very much by reaſon of its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with it; by which means it is drawn to the Affections of the Body, and to a Converſation with Senſible things, and ſo becomes Evil and Miſerable: That its Good and Happy Condition lyes in being like to God, not in regard of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but a State of Quieſcency: That the Practice of the Virtues of the Active Life is inſufficient for Aſſimilation to God; but in order to it, thoſe which are properly Intellectual are most neceſſary, whereby the Soul draws it ſelf off from the Body. Thus for the Soul to act by its ſelf, is Wiſdom; Introverſion, is Temperance; Abſtraction from Matter, is Fortitude; to follow Reaſon, is Juſtice: That by the Practice of theſe the Soul purifies its ſelf,</hi> i. e. <hi>caſts off the things without its ſelf, and ſo recovers its Purity, by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:192035:157"/>bringing thoſe things into Light again, which lay hid under the rubbiſh of Senſible things before, ſo that the Soul did not know them to be there; but for the Diſcovery of them, it was neceſſary for the Soul to come near a greater Light than its ſelf: and to bring the Images which are in it to the true Originals.</hi> The way of <hi>Purifying the Soul,</hi> he calls by the Names of <hi>Abſtraction</hi> and <hi>Recollection;</hi> which he elſe-where expreſſes by <hi>awakening the Soul out of Sleep, wherein it was diſturbed by ſenſible Images;</hi> not as though the Soul had need of any other way of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying, but only <hi>reſtraining it to its ſelf by taking away that load of Matter which oppreſſed it; and then it naturally endeavours after the nearest <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the first Being; which he calls the True Being, and the ſuper-Eſſential Being.</hi> And he ſaith, <hi>When the Soul endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, it must lay aſide all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and intellectual Images of things, and make uſe only of the purest and ſupream part of the Mind;</hi> (or the Fund of the Spirit) <hi>that God then is not to be conſidered under the Notion of Being, but as ſomething above Being; and that we are not either to affirm or deny any thing of Him:</hi> that, <hi>Our Contemplation of Him is not by Knowledge, or any Intellectual Operation; but by a Divine Preſence, which far exceeds any Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: for Knowledge,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>hinders <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion: therefore we must go beyond Knowledge, and be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:192035:158"/>abſtracted from all other Objects; and be united to Him only by the Power of Divine Love; from whence follows a clearer Light in the Soul: And in this State,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there is not only a Ceſſation of Paſſion, but of Reaſon and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding too: neither is the Perſon himſelf,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Porphyry,</hi> who was a Diſciple and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> the ſame Author gives us this account: <q>That he looked upon <hi>the Theurgick Way,</hi> as lyable to deceit, and not capable of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the Soul to higheſt Perfection. Which <hi>Theurgick Way</hi> lay in the initiating of Men in ſome Sacred Myſteries, by partaking of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rites and Symbols, by which they were admitted to the Preſence of ſome of their Deities; the End whereof, as they pretended, was, reducing the Souls of Men to that State they were in before they came into the Body. So St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us from <hi>Porphyry, That they who were purified after this manner did converſe with glorious appearances of Angels, which they were fitted to ſee:</hi> but <hi>Porphyry</hi> himſelf, as he

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:192035:159"/>Chaldaick,</hi> or any other. But what that was which he meant, appears by what he ſaith near the end of the Life of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> where he hath theſe Words: <hi>The Scope and End of his Life was <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Conjunction with God over all: and four times,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when I was with him he attained to this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, by an unexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Act of the Mind:</hi> which he before ſets forth, by <hi>a Divine Illumination without any I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or Idea, being above the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and all intelligible things.</hi> And he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>that he was once in this State of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, when he was</hi> 68 <hi>Years of Age.</hi> Which <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenius</hi> underſtands of an Extaſie he then fell into; and imputes it to <hi>the depth of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy joyned with his abſtracted and ſevere Life, his frequent Watchings, and almost conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Exerciſe of Contemplation.</hi> For all theſe things were remarkable in him: and <hi>Eunapius</hi> ſaith of him, <hi>That he was ſo little a lover of the Body, that he hated his being a Man; and being in</hi> Sicily, <hi>he was almost famiſhed by Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, and ſhunned all Converſation with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:</hi> as he begins the Life of <hi>Plotinus; That he was like one aſhamed that his Soul was in a Body.</hi> So that we find the Foundation here laid, (ſaith our Author) not only for the <hi>Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> but the <hi>Abſtraction of Mind</hi> neceſſary in order to it: and that it doth not lye in any <hi>Intellectual Operations,</hi> but rather
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:192035:159"/>in a <hi>Ceſſation of theſe Acts,</hi> is likewiſe expreſsly affirmed by <hi>Porphyry. Many things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are ſaid of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding things that are above the Mind; but the Contemplation of thoſe things is better performed,</hi>

The Way laid down by him for <hi>Purifying the Soul</hi> is this: 1. <hi>The Foundation</hi> of it is for the <hi>Soul to know it ſelf,</hi> i. e. to conſider, <hi>that it is in a ſtrange place, and bound to a thing of another Subſtance.</hi> 2. <hi>Recollection,</hi> or <hi>gathering it ſelf up from the Body, to be free from the Affections of it:</hi> In order to which he adviſeth to deny the Body in its Appetites and Pleaſures, and to ſhew as little Care of it, and Concernment for it, as may be: by degrees to leſſen all ſenſe both of Pleaſure and Pain; and ſo to come at laſt to a Freedom from the Paſſions of the Body. Then he deſcribes <hi>the Superlative Being,</hi> and ſaith, that <hi>it is neither Great, nor Little, but above both; and is neither Greateſt nor Leaſt, but above all; and that his Preſence is not Topical, but Aſſimilative; and that the only Way for our Souls to recover themſelves, is, to bring them into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; by which Means the True Being is preſent with them, and we become united to God.</hi> Which <hi>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:192035:161"/>and be made partakers of it. For we cannot reach the Divine Being either by our Senſes, or by Opinion, or by Apprehenſion; no nor yet by Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination,</hi>

                        </gap>. <hi>It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that if the Divine Nature can any ways be known by us, it must be by the Eſſence of the Soul. For the Soul being drawn into its own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and removing from it ſelf the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of its Powers, it aſcends to the greateſt height of true Contemplation. While the Soul looks about on things below it, it ſees nothing but Shadows and Images of things: When it comes to a State of Introverſion, then it ſees its own Eſſence and Operations of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding: But when it ſearches deeper, then it finds the Mind within it ſelf, and the ſeveral Orders of real Beings: When it goes yet farther into the moſt ſecret Cloſet of the Soul, there it contemplates, as it were blindfold, the Divine Beings, and the firſt Idea's or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nities of Beings. And this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the moſt excellent Operation of the Soul, in the Reſt or Quieſcency of its Powers, to ſtretch it ſelf toward the Divine Nature, and dance, as it were, round it, and to raiſe up the whole Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with it, and abſtracting it ſelf from all Inferior Beings, to reſt upon, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with that Ineffable and Super-eſſential Being.

                     <q>All <hi>theſe Notions,</hi> (ſaith our Author) both among the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and the <hi>Platonick</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, are <hi>built upon a very ancient Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> but very different from that of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which Hypotheſis being granted, this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Divinity appears with ſome face of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and colour of Probability.— It was this; That the Souls of Men did exiſt in another World long before they came into the Body; that in their Deſcent to the Body they had an Aetherial Vehicle joyned to them; which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conjunction of the Soul and Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Means of Communication between them, and takes up its chief Seat in the Brain, which is the ſame which we call the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that the Soul being in this ſtate is apt to be much inveigled with Kindneſs to the Body, and ſo forget its Return home: that the Body is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing the Soul miſchief no other way, being it ſelf under the power of Fate, then as it draws it downward: that the Mind, being the upper part of the Soul, is always acting; but we know not its operations but only by the Impreſſions they make upon the Phanſie: that the Mind hath the true Idea's of things within it ſelf; but we are deceived by the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations conveyed by our Imagination; and therefore our Ratiocination is very ſhort and uncertain: that our only way of Recovering our Souls, is by drawing them off from the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:192035:162"/>Body, and retiring into themſelves; and that upon this the Mind hath the Divine Being ſo nearly conjoyned to it, that it paſſeth into a Divine Nature, and recovers its former State, when it parts from the Body. But becauſe it is not to return alone without the Aetherial Vehicle it brought with it, therefore the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> had ſeveral Sacred and Symbolical Rites for the purifying of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle, as they called it, which they made ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for this End: and with them <hi>Jamblicus</hi> joyns, but <hi>Porphyry</hi> thought them not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but that Philoſophy and meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation would purifie enough without it. This is the true Account of their Hypotheſis, as may be fully ſeen in <hi>Hierocles</hi> and <hi>Syneſius,</hi> without going farther; and was the <hi>firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Myſtical Divinity,</hi> which I will not deny to be well enough accommodated to it. But it is as <hi>remote</hi> from Chriſtianity, as the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> it ſelf is.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is ſaid by our Author to diſparage <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Divinity;</hi> becauſe he ſuppoſeth it will not be conſented to by any that are Friends to it. But how doth it appear that this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> was the firſt Foundation of <hi>Myſtical Divinity;</hi> which, for any thing he hath ſhewed to the contrary, may be more ancient than it? His bare affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in his own Caſe certainly is not to be admitted for Proof. But in caſe that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:192035:162"/>how is that <hi>different</hi> from Chriſtianity; for he would not ſay <hi>contrary;</hi> though, no doubt, many of his Readers would be apt to take it ſo? The <hi>Jews</hi> did believe it before our Saviour's time; the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> doth favour it; the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion concerning <hi>the Man, who was born Blind,</hi> doth favour it; nor doth <hi>our Saviour's Anſwer</hi> at all contradict it, but rather ſuppoſe it: and it hath been aſſerted by Learned Men, both of the <hi>Church of England</hi> and other <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> from Proofs of Scripture, as well as Reaſon. His Concluſion alſo is obſervable, that <hi>Myſtical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> is as <hi>remote</hi> from <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> it ſelf; ſuch another cautious Expreſſion not to expoſe himſelf, but by which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of his Readers may eaſily be impoſed upon. Truth is a very venerable thing; and Divine matters ought to be treated with great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; the very Heathen Myſticks would have thought ſo, whatever our Rationatiſts think.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe ancient Philoſophers, our Author takes notice of the like Notions and Practices among <hi>other Gentiles,</hi> even at this day; but of what antiquity amongſt them he ſaith not. It is taken from a <hi>Letter of Monfieur Bernier</hi> to Monſieur <hi>Chaplain,</hi> dated 4 <hi>Octob.</hi> 1667. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Gentiles of Indoſtan,</hi> wherein he gives an account <q>of certain Orders of Religious among them, who make Vows of Chaſtity, Poverty, and Obedience, living in Convents
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:192035:163"/>under Superiors, who are commonly called <hi>Jauguis,</hi> i. e. <hi>united to God,</hi> who uſed themſelves to many Hardſhips, and were looked on as ſo many Eremites by the People, being accounted true Saints, illuminated and perfect <hi>Jauguis: Theſe are People that have entirely abandoned the World, and ſequeſtered themſelves into ſome very remote Corner or Garden, like Eremites, without ever coming to the Town. If you carry them any Meat, they receive it; if they do not, 'tis believed that they can live without it, and ſubfist by the ſole Favour of God in perpetual Faſting, Prayer, and profound Meditations: for they ſink themſelves ſo deep into theſe Raptures, that they ſpend many hours together in being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, and beholding in that time, as they give out, God himſelf, like a very bright and ineffable Light, with an unexpreſſible Joy and Satisfaction, attended with an intire Contempt and forſaking of the World. For thus much one of them, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he could enter into this Rapture when he pleaſed, and had been often in it, told me; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are about them affirm the thing with ſo much ſeriouſneſs, that they ſeem to believe it in earnest, that there is no Impoſture in it.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe <hi>others</hi> might be added, who have had the like Notions, and uſed the like Exerciſes, as well anciently, as at this time. Such as the <hi>Indian Brachmans</hi> or <hi>Gymnoſophiſts,</hi> the <hi>Perſian Magi,</hi> and the <hi>Druides,</hi> who are ſaid by ſome to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:192035:163"/>have been as ancient as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time. The Character given by <hi>Bardiſanes Syrus</hi> of the BRACHMANES, that they <hi>neither worſhip Images, nor eat what is animate; neither drink Wine, or Beer; are far from all Malignity, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly to God;</hi> is comprehenſive enough to take in both the Auſterities and Contemplations of thoſe before-mentioned. But the religious <hi>Care</hi> of the Ancients <hi>to conceal their moſt Sacred Myſteries</hi> from the Vulgar, and their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them principally by ſucceſſive verbal Tradition, is a great reaſon that we have ſo little of this in any Writings, not only of the reſt, whom we call <hi>Heathens,</hi> but even of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> However, it is plain by what is collected by our Author, that theſe Notions and Exerciſes were not firſt introduced by <hi>Plotinus</hi> and his Diſciples, but derived to them from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> And if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from what <hi>Original</hi> they derived them, it will be hard to diſcover any other than either <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity, as many aſſert; or at leaſt the common Parent <hi>Noah;</hi> ſo that what our Author has collected to diſparage <hi>Myſtical Theology,</hi> being well conſidered, will prove a notable Recommendation of it. For as it is moſt reaſonable to believe that <hi>Noah</hi> did inſtruct his Poſterity in all things of greateſt Importance to them; and that the Knowledge of them was tranſmitted to after-Generations, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:192035:164"/>to the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> in ſome ſort or other; but to the <hi>Jews</hi> intirely, and without Mixture of Corruptions; ſo it is not to be doubted, but ſuch inquiſite Perſons, and eſpecially into Divine Myſteries, as <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> Men of ſuch extraordinary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo favoured as they were, muſt have obtained a compleat Knowledge of them from all theſe Nations; and eſpecially at that time, in and after the Captivity, when they ſeem by Divine Providence to have been carried away out of their own Countrey for that very end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that God's dealings with them might be more fully known to other Nations. For the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> was undoubtedly deſigned by Almighty God to be a Light and Admonition to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> even from the beginning in all their various States; in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> in the <hi>Land of Canaan,</hi> in their <hi>Captivity,</hi> and in their <hi>Diſperſion</hi> to this very day. Nor do I at all doubt but there was ſo much Knowledge of Truth derived from them to other Nations, as together with what is obſervable in the Works of God, and what was received from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Anceſtors, was ſufficient for the Salvation of all, who uſed and improved the ſame as they ought; and for the juſt Condemnation of the reſt, who neglected it. And therefore, if we find that theſe Men were acquainted with the <hi>Myſtick Divinity,</hi> that is, with the thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:192035:164"/>under that Name or any other, it matters not; if we find undeniable Evidence of it among the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and others before; if we find the moſt ancient <hi>Chriſtian Aſceticks</hi> well acquainted with it, and much, or rather altogether in the Practice of it, before <hi>Dionyſius</hi> his <hi>Theologia Myſtica</hi> was known in the World; this put together is ſuch a Conſtellation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current and corroborating Evidences, that whenceſoever that Name, and ſome Terms and Expreſſions, which ſeem ſomewhat uncouth, came in after Ages, yet that the thing it ſelf muſt have been derived from ſome very ancient common Original to thoſe Nations; and to thoſe <hi>Chriſtian Aſceticks,</hi> not from the Collections of the Adverſaries of Chriſtianity, (which is a meer groundleſs Oratorical Fiction to expoſe it) no more than from <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> whom our Author doth not believe to have been ſo ancient; but either from ſome of the firſt Converts of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or, which ſeems more likely, from a Divine Conduct and Inſpiration: for they were many of them unacquainted with Humane Learning. Nor do I ſee any reaſon to think that the Inſtitutions of <hi>the Sons of the Prophets</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> were much different from the <hi>Myſtical Theology,</hi> which is thus oppoſed by our Author; but rather that the ſame Inſtitutions were conveyed, as Secrets, by Tradition to ſome principal Men of all Nations, from the Common Parent <hi>Noah.</hi>

                  <p> And indeed, if we do but fairly, that is can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly and without Prejudice, conſider that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Divinity, which our Author hath choſen for his purpoſe to collect from a late Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Father <hi>Auſtin Baker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi>'s <hi>Preface,</hi> I ſuppoſe it will ſufficiently recommend it ſelf, as no improper or unlikely Method to have been uſed by the ancient Prophets. <q>Let the Reader judge of it (ſaith he, and ſo ſay I) by theſe Paſſages in his (<hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi>'s) Preface 1. <hi>The only proper Diſpoſition towards receiving Supernatural Irradiations from God's Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is an Abſtraction of Life; a Sequeſtration from all Buſineſs that concerns others; and an Attendance to God alone in the Depth of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> And a little after: 2. <hi>The Lights here deſired and prayed for, are ſuch as do expell all Images of Creatures, and do calm all manner of Paſſions to the end the Soul being in a Vacuity, may be more capable of receiving and entertaining God in the pure Fund of the Spirit.</hi>

                     <q>Elſewhere, ſaith our Author, he (Fa. <hi>Baker</hi>) deſcribes the Progreſs towards this State of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thus; <hi>That he who would come to it muſt practiſe the drawing of his External Senſes inwardly to his internal, there loſing, and, as it were, annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating them: then he muſt draw his Internal Senſes into the Superior powers of the Soul, and there annihilate them likewiſe: And thoſe Powers of the Intellectual Soul he muſt draw into that which is called the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity; and to that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, which alone is capable of perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with God, muſt be applyed and firmly fixed on God, wherein the perfect Divine Contemplation lyes.</hi>
                     </q> It is true, theſe words are in Father <hi>Baker;</hi> but they are but what he ſaith we read in other Authors: and beſides he adds: <q>
                        <hi>Now, whether ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as theſe will abide the ſtrict Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Philoſophy or no, I will not take on me to determine. Certain it is, that by a frequent and conſtant Exerciſe of Internal Prayer of the Will, joyned with Mortification, the Soul comes to operate more and more abſtracted from Senſe, and more celebrated above the Corporeal Organs and Faculties; ſo drawing near to the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Operations of an Angel or Separated Spirit.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this we may perceive, that it is <hi>not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,</hi> as our Author ſaith, <hi>to put together ſome
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:192035:168"/>of their Words and Phraſes, as an Account of their Divinity;</hi> (p. 285.) and what Account that is. But beſides theſe, there are ſome other paſſages which he recites; and in them ſome, which he conſtrues, as he doth theſe and other things; and ſome Expreſſions, which may ſeem hard Sayings to one, who is not willing to underſtand them, or conſider them as terms of Art, and allow them a candid Conſtruction; and may afford Matter for Exerciſe of Wit to ſuch as are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſport themſelves with Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The wicked Spirit does eaſily inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate himſelf into, and impoſe upon <hi>Perſons ingaged in Controverſy;</hi> they are ordinarily like Souldiers ingaged in War, act as if all was Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whereby they can incommode an Adverſary, without due regard to Charity, Truth, and that fair Dealing and Kindneſs which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity enjoyns to Enemies; and too often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves like ſuch Souldiers, as are loath to have an End of a War leſt they ſhould want Employment, trifling and skirmiſhing at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, with vain Words and Shews: and the conſequence in each is frequently the baffling and diſparaging of the Cauſe they are ingaged in, and giving advantages to their Adverſaries. And I wiſh this Author, by his management, hath not given too much Advantage, or at leaſt Occaſion, to the common Adverſaries, Infidels and Deiſts. But as to this cauſe, <hi>O. N.</hi> hath ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:192035:168"/>fully anſwered all Cavils at the Terms of Art, that it ſeems he left little to be replyed to: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for Anſwer, our Author is reduced to theſe two ſhifts: 1. To inculcate the Unintelligibleneſs of Myſtick Theology, from the ceſſation of the diſcurſive Faculty at the time of Contemplation, (which is all that the Myſtick Writers intend) as if all Men, in the very act of intent liſtening to Sounds, or beholding ſomething extraordinary, did not the like in a great meaſure. 2. To make a great Bravado, as if he had the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the whole Church of Chriſt againſt all Viſions, immediate Revelations, Extaſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Montanus;</hi> Whereas what was condemned in <hi>Montanus</hi> and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, was not the pretending to Viſions and Revelations; but pretending ſuch to be Divine, which were not; but Diabolical, as appeared both by the Manner, and by the Matter, being Hereſie: as is very plain in the ancient Writer in <hi>Euſebius, l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>When the Faithful throughout</hi> Aſia <hi>had met often, and in many places of</hi> Aſia, <hi>upon this account, and had inquired into this New Doctrine, and determined it to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and rejected this Hereſie, they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled out of the Church.</hi> And before he relates how <hi>Montanus</hi> his Ambition gave the Enemy an Entrance into himſelf, and he was filled with the Devil, and of a ſudden poſſeſt with a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and frantick Temper of Mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:192035:169"/>ſaith of <hi>Theodotus,</hi> that he was poſſeſt with a falſe Extaſie, which plainly implies true ones believed then, contrary to what our Author doth pretend. To ſay that it hath no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Chriſtian Doctrine, and yet to paſs by ſo many Teſtimonies of Scripture produced for it, with no better anſwer than what amounts to a Conceſſion, deſerves no other reply than only to note it. To miſtake and miſ-repreſent Mens Words through Ignorance, is a Fault, but more eſpecially in Men pretending to Learning and Knowledge; yet hath that ſome excuſe, by reaſon of the Humane Infirmity incident to all. But to do it wilfully, deliberately, and ſeeking Occaſions, is not only different from, but contrary to the Spirit of Chriſtianity. But what is it then, if it be in deſpight of that which is really true, and the Operations of the Spirit of Grace? To ſay that the <hi>Caſe of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> was the very <hi>Caſe of Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions;</hi> and that the Spirit of <hi>Montanus</hi> was rejected in the Chriſtian Church as a Fanatick Enthuſiaſtical Spirit; as if the Caſe of Myſtical Unions was the Caſe of that Spirit ſo rejected, with other expreſſions to like purpoſe, are fit to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered afterward, if they were not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered before-hand. There is a paſſage, which he recites out of the Spiritual Exerciſes of the Jeſuites, <hi>p.</hi> 31, 32. <hi>edit.</hi> 1574. <hi>viz. It is the great Perfection of a Chriſtian to keep himſelf
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:192035:169"/>indifferent, to do what God ſhall reveal to him; and not to determine himſelf to do what he hath already revealed and taught in the Goſpel:</hi> which is very groſs indeed, if the meaning be what he would have us to believe; and indeed ſo groſs, that it is not to be believed to be their meaning, if it be to be found there, and fairly tranſlated: but ſince it is capable of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtruction, <hi>viz.</hi> not to confine ones ſelf to what is revealed in general; but to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as to things not determined, but left indifferent, to do as God ſhall direct: I know not what can be ſaid of any weight againſt it: Such a Conſtruction had been but according to their own Rule: <hi>Chriſtianum unumquemque pium debere promptiore animo Sententiam ſeu Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitionem obſcuram alterius in bonam trahere par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, quam damnare,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exercit. Spirit.</hi> p. 65. edit. <hi>Ant.</hi> 1676. 8<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> which had been more worthy of our Author's Obſervation. Nor do I ſee any reaſon to alledge, as an Inſtance or Proof of their Fanaticiſm, that Cuſtom of <hi>Ignatius</hi> and his Companions, related by <hi>Orlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinus, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 111. <hi>viz. In any matter of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate they were to joyn together in Prayer; and after ſeeking God, what Opinion the most were of, that they reſolve upon.</hi> Where was the Fault in this? in joyning in Prayer? or in agreeing with the Majority? If the <hi>Odium</hi> of the Name will excuſe any thing with the vulgar; yet it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:192035:170"/>becomes neither Chriſtianity, nor Ingenuity, nor is it conſiſtent with true Prudence, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to ſuch mean Objections. <hi>Over-doing</hi> doth often ſpoil a good Work, and diſparage and diſcredit the Author. The <hi>Errors and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of Devout People</hi> ought to be pitied, mentioned with Grief, and not expoſed beyond Truth or Neceſſity: For that makes ſport for the Devils and wicked Men; gives Scandal to weak Men; promotes Uncharitableneſs and Irreligion; and diſcompoſeth and diſordereth the Spirit of him that doth it. He who judgeth others, ought to take care that they riſe not up in Judgment hereafter againſt himſelf. How will that Fanaticiſm, which carries Men to the fartheſt part of the World for the Converſion of Infidels to Chriſtianity, riſe up in Judgment againſt them, who ſuffer their own Pariſhes and Dioceſſes of profeſſed Chriſtians at home, to ſink into Infidelity, for want of due Care and ſufficient Inſtruction? And how will the Exceſs of Devotion (if it be ſo) in ſome Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Writers, riſe up in Judgment againſt ſuch as will be found to have given occaſion to Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, Careleſſneſs, and Neglect of the moſt Spiritual Exerciſes of Religion?</p>

                  <p>THERE is another part of the Quarrel, which our Author hath to this <hi>Myſtical Divinity,</hi> beſides that, that it is unintelligible, as he ſays, <hi>viz.</hi> That it leads Perſons into ſtrange <hi>Illuſions</hi> of Fancy; which he takes to be a great Injury, not only to thoſe Melancholy Souls that are led through this Valley of Shades and Darkneſs; but to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion it ſelf. Which, if true, is a juſt Cauſe of Quarrel indeed: But if well conſider'd, no greater Cauſe than others have againſt the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> becauſe ſome wreſt them to their own Deſtruction, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.

And becauſe <hi>O.

                  <p> FOR the diſcerning of ſuch <hi>Illuſions,</hi> proceeding from <hi>Satan,</hi> from the true <hi>Inſpirations</hi> of <hi>God's Holy Spirit,</hi> we affirm, That many <hi>Notes and Obſervations</hi> there be, whereby they may be known, if not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whether Divine, as to their Original; (where no Spirit of Prophecy or Miracles:) yet whether containing Truth, and advancing Vertue, as to the Matter; and whether any way noxious and hurtful, either to the Perſon that receives them, or others. And this is abundantly ſufficient. Now for theſe <hi>Notes</hi> of diſcerning them, I need referr the Reader to no other Book then to the Doctor's Martyr, <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> (though he was pleaſed to take no notice of them there) in the <hi>Preface,</hi> from §. 29. to §. 35. Again, in the <hi>third Treatiſe,</hi> p. 268. from §. 9. to §. 22. where, after directing a ſtrict Obſervation to be made concerning the Perſon, whether, 1. vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inclin'd; 2. arrogant and proud; or, 3. curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; 4. or much addicted to melancholy, there are particularly caſt off, and marked out for <hi>Satanical Illuſions;</hi> among others, theſe: <q>
                        <hi>All ſuch</hi> pretended Inſpirations or Revelations as do invite the Perſon to ſay or do any thing contrary to the Catholick Faith, Obedience, Humility, Peace, and Unity, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, Purity, and <hi>any other Divine Vertue:</hi>
                     </q> but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>contrary to the Catholick Faith, or Obedience;</hi> for inſtance, as the <hi>attempting to make any new and ſeditious Reformations;</hi> as likewiſe, when the Perſons <hi>obſtinately believe theſe Revelations to be of God, after they have been condemned by experienced Superiors and Directors.</hi> All ſuch, I ſay, are condemned for <hi>Satanical</hi> Illuſions, which cuts all the nerves of all ſuch pretended Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as can any way diſturb the <hi>Church's Faith, or Peace;</hi> and moſt of all, of thoſe Enthuſiaſms and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:192035:171"/>Frenzies which have been ſo common among <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>— §. 14.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, in all theſe Pretenſions, where there is any greater difficulty of diſcerning the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> from the <hi>Bad</hi> and <hi>Satanical</hi> Spirit, we have a judge to repair to, the <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church; The Spirits of the Prophets,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, are ſubject to the Prophets.</hi>— §. 15.</p>
                  <p>But there are other Influences and Inſpirations of the ſame Spirit, directing us alſo in <hi>Actions in their own nature Indifferent, or of Counſel,</hi> and on either ſide lawful, and free from Sin; ſome of which Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations cannot be tried, or diſtinguiſhed from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, by any ſuch way as the former; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are much ſpoken of by the Myſticks, and are very neceſſary for advancing Chriſtians in the way of Perfection, it ſeems requiſite, for the freeing theſe alſo from Miſtakes, to give the Reader here ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. §. 18.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

We muſt know therefore, That to ſuch end this <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> received in our Regeneration aſſiſteth and worketh in us, not only as to affording generally to all good Chriſtians that ſeriouſly endeavour to ſave their Souls, ſuch <hi>internal Illuminations</hi> and <hi>Motions</hi> as are ſufficient to direct them for the <hi>reſiſting</hi> of any <hi>ſinful</hi> Temptation, or to perform any <hi>neceſſary act</hi> of Vertue, in Circumſtances wherein they are <hi>obliged</hi> to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:192035:173"/>it; but alſo, in affording us Light and Ability in all <hi>indifferent</hi> Actions and Occurrences, (with which may be alſo joyned all the Acts of Chriſtian Vertues, when no neceſſity obligeth us to do any of them, and ſo when it is lawful for us, without Sin, to do or omit them) whereby we are guided to make ſuch a Choice, as is more conformable to God's Will, and, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Circumſtances conſidered, may much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance us in the Love of God, and Chriſtian Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and whereby we may avoid ſuch other of them as may be ſuggeſted, either by <hi>corrupt Nature,</hi> or the <hi>evil Spirit,</hi> under pretence alſo of ſome Good End, but to defeat a Better.

                  <p n="3">3. Theſe Actions of the latter kind, we are now ſpeaking of, that may be lawfully done, or omitted, the one or the other performed, without any guilt of Sin, are either ſuch, as, by the Evangelical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and the dictate of rectified Reaſon, are <hi>clearly</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:192035:174"/>diſcerned by us; the one to be <hi>better,</hi> and more to lead to Chriſtian Perfection than the other; or ſuch, where we have ſome <hi>doubt</hi> of theſe two Actions, good or lawful, which is the better, or more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. In the former of theſe we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that that which is <hi>manifest</hi> to us to be the better, as to our Perfection, is the motion in us of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> and that the doing it, is the doing the <hi>Will of God</hi> in this matter; and that ſo often as we reject or neglect this, ſo often we <hi>contriſtate</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> (that would thus conduct us to Perfection,) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to do <hi>God's Will,</hi> when this is known to us; whoſe Will it ought always to be preſumed to be, that we ſhould do that which is clear to us, all things conſidered, to be beſt, for his Glory, and our Good, to be done; though ſuch omiſſion or neglect amounts not to a Sin, but to a Failing ſo much in Perfection. And indeed the not vigilantly obſerving theſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit</hi> within us, and the not hearkening to and obeying them when evident to be ſuch, or alſo the not preconſulting by Prayer what it adviſeth, but rather precipitating our Action to prevent it, is the reaſon of ſo many their no greater Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Spirit, and that they are ſuch ſtrangers to it, and It to them, is a check to the further and ſtronger operations of it in the Soul; (for, Who would offer Counſel, ſeldom or never accepted, or asked?) abates the Fervour and Solace that there would be in proſecuting its Suggeſtions, and leaves us guilty of much Unkindneſs and Ingratitude. For, as St. <hi>Bernard, Cum hae Sancti Spiritus circa nos diſpenſatoriae quidem viciſſitudines vigilantiſſime non obſervantur, fit, ut nec abſentem deſideres, nec preſentem glorifices,</hi> in Cant. Serm. 17. <hi>When theſe condeſcending viciſſitneſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us are not most watchfully heeded, it comes to paſs

                  </p>
                  <p>But in the latter Actions, wherein we have ſome cauſe of doubt, which is beſt, and yet wherein the making a good choice may be exceedingly beneficial to us, (according to the variety of our Temper and Condition) to the better ordering of our Life and Service of God, ſuch Illumination and Direction of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> or alſo a <hi>clear diſcerning</hi> thereof, is obtained eſpecially by much <hi>Purity</hi> of Converſation, and <hi>Abſtraction</hi> from Worldly things; by frequent <hi>Recollection,</hi> and Introverſion, and attendance on God, in the perfecteſt Practice of <hi>Prayer</hi> we can attain to. For God hath graciouſly declared to us in the Scriptures; <hi>That the effectual Prayer of a Righteous man</hi> (as that of <hi>Elias</hi>) <hi>availeth much,</hi> Jam. 5.17. <hi>That he heareth not Sinners,</hi> but <hi>if any one be a Worſhipper of him, and doth his Will, him he heareth,</hi> Jo. 9.31. That <hi>all things whatſoever we ſhall ask in Prayer,</hi> (that is, ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) <hi>not doubting, but believing, we ſhall receive them,</hi> Mat. 21.22. Mar. 11.23.

(becauſe indeed ſuch ask by the Spirit of Chriſt, who liveth in them, and ſo ask according to God's Will.) That <hi>if we keep his Commandments, and do what is pleaſing in God's</hi> ſight, <hi>what-ever we ask we receive of him,</hi> 1 Jo. 3.22. That <hi>if we ask any thing according to his Will he heareth us,</hi> (and grants our requeſts,) 1 Jo. 5.14. that <hi>though we know not what we ſhould deſire, or pray for as we ought,</hi> Rom. 8.26, 27. (that is, as to temporal Proſperity, or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, or ſuch like things, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeaks, what therein is beſt for God's Glory, or our own Proficiency) yet the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> within us with <hi>unutterable Groans</hi> and great Ardour <hi>interceedeth for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:192035:175"/>us</hi> according to God's Will; and <hi>that God knoweth its Mind,</hi> (though not expreſſed in Words) and granteth its requeſts: that the ſame <hi>Spirit ſearcheth the profound things of God,</hi> (and what is his Will) and <hi>revealeth</hi> them to us; that natural Reaſon is not able to underſtand them, but they many times ſeem <hi>Fooliſhneſs</hi> to it: but the things of the Spirit are <hi>diſcerned</hi> only by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moſt of which Texts ſeem to be ſpoken, not only of our petitioning God concerning the neceſſary means of our or others Salvation; but more univerſally of all ſorts of Requeſts concerning the things of this Life, and any things that are in their nature indifferent, and lawful; and of his Spirit directing us to ask and do in them what is his Will; and of his grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe to us which may be beſt for us; wherein God heareth, and granteth the Petitions of his Saints much ſooner than of others. §. 21.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then, ſince God in the Scriptures hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared theſe things, and made theſe Promiſes, that he will not deny what we ask according to his Will, we may rationally preſume and be piouſly confident, that he will grant our Requeſt, when this is, only to <hi>know</hi> his <hi>Will,</hi> that we may do that which is according to it; and we may ſafely take that for his Will, to which, after ſuch Addreſſes, and other due Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made, we ſhall find our ſelves more ſtrongly inclined; and alſo take ſuch Inclination to proceed from the Operation of God's Spirit, either illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating ſometimes our Underſtanding, in diſcovering to it ſome Reaſons not ſo well diſcerned; or elſe diſeſteemed, and thought inconſiderable before; Or ſometimes more confirming to us the Judgment our own Reaſon made of the thing before: Or ſometimes effecting a ſtrong and ſuddenly injected Inclination
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:192035:176"/>in the Will, ſo ſwayed without any preceeding Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or diſcourſe of the Intellect preſented (to) it: Or ſometimes cauſing an extraordinary Tranquility, Conſolation, and Satisfaction to accompany ſuch our Election; (According to the Rule of Abbot <hi>Iſaac</hi> in <hi>Caſſian,</hi> Collat. 9. c. 32. <hi>Cum orantes nos nulla interpellaverit haeſitatio, ſi obtinuiſſe nos in ipſa orationis effuſione, quod poſcimus, ſenſerimus, non ambigamus preces noſtras ad Deum efficaciter penetraſſe;</hi> where note, that the Devil, or any Creature, cannot work ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and intimately on our Underſtanding and Will, as God's Spirit doth; but by the uſe of Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms, or Images; of the Spirits, Humours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Or, where no ſuch preponderation to any ſide is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Soul, then we may preſume this to be his Will, that, making uſe of our beſt Reaſon, or others Advice, without any Solicitude, we take either ſide. §. 22.</p>
                  <p>Now, in the diſcerning of theſe <hi>Divine Illuminations</hi> and <hi>Inſpirations,</hi> from <hi>Enthuſiaſms;</hi> or the <hi>Motions of the Good,</hi> from thoſe of our <hi>own,</hi> or a <hi>Bad Spirit,</hi> in theſe matters; as any one hath attained to a greater Perfection in Prayer, and Mortification and Purity of Life, they attain hereby a greater meaſure of God's Spirit, and hence its Illuminations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirings in them are alſo much greater and ſtronger, and more intimately effective on the Soul, than any other Motions, from whenceſoever they come, can be; and ſo alſo theſe become more evident to ſuch, and many times are ſo clearly diſcerned by them, from the Supernatural impreſſion they make upon the Soul, as that it cannot reſiſt, disbelieve, or any way doubt of them, that they are Supernatural and Divine. So St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> relates of his Mother <hi>Monica,</hi> that ſhe clearly knew ſuch Supernatural actings in her
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:192035:176"/>from her own Imaginations; <hi>Dicebat enim, diſcernere ſe neſcio quo ſapore, quem verbis explicare non poterat, quid intereſſet inter revelantem Te, &amp; animam ſuam ſomnian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> Confeſſ. l. 6. c. 13. <hi>For ſhe ſaid, ſhe did diſcern, by I know not what Savour, which ſhe could not explain in words, what difference there is between Thee revealing, and her own Soul dreaming.</hi> And indeed, if ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Divine Operations were not ſometimes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly diſcernable, how could St. <hi>Paul</hi> be aſſured, when he intended to Preach the Word in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and again in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> (a moſt Charitable deſign!) that the <hi>Spirit</hi> forbad it; and not rather the Enemy of the publiſhing of the Goſpel? <hi>Act.</hi> 16.6, 7. or, That it was <hi>by Revelation,</hi> and not a Fancy of his, that he aſcended to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Gal. 2.2. or, That it was the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> that <hi>teſtified,</hi> and not Mens Fears, that much Affliction ſhould happen to him there? <hi>Act.</hi> 20.23. How the <hi>Corinthians</hi> knew, when they had a Revelation, that it was not a work of their own Imagination? ſince all theſe things were tranſacted only interiourly in the Soul, and it was the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> only, that in all theſe gave the Evidence to it ſelf. A certain Aſſurance then, it cannot be denyed, that ſome at ſometimes may have of Divine Operations in them. But yet it is not affirmed here, that all Perſons, leſs advanced in Prayer, and Purity of Life, or alſo the greateſt Saints at all times, diſcern the Operations of the Holy Spirit within them ſo clearly in this ſort of Actions, as not to be ſometimes miſtaken; and it is ſufficient, that Perſons piouſly diſpoſed, and frequent in Prayer, may have a rational preſumption of it, as hath been ſaid.

                  <head>Directions <hi>given by</hi> Spiritual Writers <hi>concerning</hi> Prayer <hi>and</hi> Devotion.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FIRST for Preparation for</hi> Prayer, <hi>they are adviſed</hi> (1.) to a ſerious Endeavour <hi>at all times</hi> to keep their Conſcience clear from <hi>all</hi> Sin, <hi>even the leaſt,</hi> as much as Humane Frailty permits; and to a Care of avoiding the <hi>Occaſions</hi> thereof; without which Endeavours our Devotions cannot be acceptable to God, as to the receiving from him any great plenty of his Grace: And (2.) at times of Prayer to Abſtraction from all Secular Buſineſs, Recollection of the Mind and Thoughts from all Creatures, and all Objects of the Exterior Senſes.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>then to begin at first with</hi> Forms for all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of <hi>Vocal Prayer,</hi> where Novices, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> begin, and which the moſt perfect alſo frequently return to. §. 25.</p>
                  <p>From theſe they are led on to <hi>Mental Prayer;</hi> in which the Ceſſation from External Action ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Inward more attent and affective; more free from Diſtraction of the Senſes, and from the Wandring of the Thoughts. For this many uſeful Subjects of <hi>Meditation</hi> are recommended, chiefly touching our own Miſery, the Myſteries of our Salvation, and the Divine Perfections.: 1. Of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:192035:178"/>their Natural Condition, the Heinouſneſs of Sin, the Divine Juſtice, the bitter Paſſion of our Lord in Satisfaction for Sin, the Terrors of Death, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Hell, to plant in them the Due Fear of God, and advance in them all ſorts of Mortification and Purification from all Habits of Sin. 2. Of the Life of our Lord, and the Lives of his Saints, for Imitation and Growth in Vertue. And, 3. of the Divine Perfections and Benefits, both received and promiſed; of the Graces and Operations of the Holy Ghoſt in us, and the Abilities for doing Good and pleaſing God reſtored to Man by it, if atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively obſerved and obeyed; to advance them in all Spiritual Grace and Chriſtian Perfection, and to enkindle in them an ardent <hi>Love</hi> of God; the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of which Love, and not of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> being chiefly deſigned in them. §. 26.</p>
                  <p>When by the Practice of theſe Meditations they are well prepared, they are directed, by laying more aſide their former <hi>Reaſonings</hi> and Diſcourſings of the Brain, (with the frequent ſtroaks of which they have already kindled this Fire in the Heart) how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe theſe Affections now, in that Leſſon <hi>of Loving God with all the Heart, and all the Soul, and all the Mind, and all the Strength,</hi> Luke 10.27. in a more ſimple and quiet Intuition and Contemplation, Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and Admiration of the Divine Beauty, and Perfections; and in more fervent and amorous Colloquies with God; in Praiſing, Thanking, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing her ſelf with him, whilſt ſhe caſts her eye upon his infinite Mercies <hi>past</hi> and <hi>promiſed;</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reſolutions for the future to ſerve him better, and no more ſo to grieve and offend him; in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſhe hath, ſhe can do, or ſuffer, to his Service; and in putting her ſelf in a poſture of Silence and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:192035:178"/>Attention, to hear what he may be pleaſed to ſpeak to and in her: ſpeak to her, not only in Guiding and Admoniſhing in all neceſſary Duty, but alſo in things indifferent, or alſo good, but not neceſſary, when ſeveral of them happen to fall under delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in which ſhe alſo deſires to be inſtructed by him, that ſhe may ſtill chuſe and do, that which may better pleaſe him, and wherein his Holy Will may be more perfectly accompliſhed. §. 27.</p>
                  <p>Which <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> when once to a competent degree facilitated in us, as they fill the Soul with great <hi>Conſolations,</hi> ſo they exceedingly help to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it in all Chriſtian Duties and <hi>Vertues.</hi> For <hi>Love</hi> will not be idle, and works in us now with much more Fidelity and Alacrity, as doing all things not out of Fear, but Affection; and not to obey, but pleaſe her <hi>Beloved,</hi> and gain from him alſo a reciprocal Love. And when a Soul is arrived ſo far, through the conſtant Exerciſe and Cuſtom of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and other <hi>Mortifications</hi> neceſſary to it, that theſe Acts of <hi>Love,</hi> and of the <hi>Will,</hi> (of which there are many ſeveral <hi>Degrees</hi> ſurpaſſing one another) are rendered eaſie and frequent, and upon every Occaſion ſpeedily reſumed, without any or much preceedent meditation; which <hi>Acts</hi> before were diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and rare: And when the Soul, by reaſon of the greater Sweetneſs ſhe finds in this latter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective Meditation, as I may call it, returns not to the former inventive Meditation without ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance, this is the firſt Entrance into that which is ſtiled a <hi>State of Perfection,</hi> ſuch as Humane Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry attains; namely, wherein the Will aſſiſted with Grace excites it ſelf to theſe <hi>Acts of Love</hi> and <hi>ſimple Contemplation.</hi> Of which Practice thus St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> De interiori Domo, c. 14. <hi>Jam fortaſſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:192035:179"/>aſcendiſti, jam ad cor tuum rediiſti, &amp; ibi ſtare didiciſti: nec hoc ſufficiat tibi; Diſce habitare, &amp; manſionem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere; &amp; qualicunque mentis vagatione abſtractus fueris, illuc ſemper redire feſtina. Abſque dubio per multum uſum quandoque tibi vertetur in oblectamentum in tantum ut abſque ulla laboris difficultate poſſis ibi aſſiduus eſſe; quin imo poena potius tibi ſit alibi quam ibi moram aliquam facere.</hi> 
                     <q>Thou haſt now perhaps aſcended; thou haſt now returned to thy Heart; and haſt learned to ſtand there: Nor let this ſuffice thee: Learn to dwell, learn to make thy abode (there.) And with whatever Wandering of Mind thou ſhalt be withdrawn, make haſte always to return thither. Without doubt by much uſe it will at one time or other be turned to Delight to thee, inſomuch, that without any laborious Difficulty thou may'ſt be there continually; yea, rather it will be a Pain to thee to make any ſtay any where elſe than there.</q> Thus He; yet is the Soul not directed here to remain idle, ſtupid, or unactive, but to return to its wonted <hi>Meditations;</hi> and if neither fitly diſpoſed for theſe, to <hi>Vocal</hi> and <hi>ſet Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer;</hi> or alſo to <hi>Reading,</hi> when the Sweetneſs of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation ceaſeth. §. 28.</p>
                  <p>Devout Souls advanced hitherto are directed and provoked to yet much higher flights, and by their continued Devotions to proſecute a further Fruition of that Object, which hath no bounds. To this purpoſe, for their Encouragement, is declared to them, from Perſons experienced therein, the many rich <hi>Rewards of Prayer;</hi> the Supernatural Elevations that God is pleaſed to advance ſome Souls to, who have been much practiſed in this <hi>Holy Exerciſe,</hi> and the more free and <hi>familiar Manifeſtations</hi> of himſelf that he makes to them in ſeveral manners mentioned
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:192035:179"/>before; wherein the Soul doth not now <hi>act</hi> ſo much, as, in a great Quietneſs, Silence, and reſt of its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer natural Operations, is more immediately moved and <hi>acted</hi> by a more ſpecial Preſence of God in it, who ſometimes with the Touches and Influences of an extraordinary Grace doth illuminate, inflame, and raviſh the Soul, and cauſeth in it an ineffable and tranſporting <hi>Delight</hi> in Contemplating what is ſhewed to it of the <hi>Divine Beauty</hi> and <hi>Perfections;</hi> perceiving in it ſelf a moſt ardent Love, and this Supernaturally infuſed; when alſo are communicated to it many times Coeleſtial Secrets, and Divine Myſteries, and future Events, by internal Words and Revelation. All which things are received by it with a great Tranquility, and Attention, and Ceſſation of the Natural uſe of its Faculties, Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or Intellectual: Nor ſeems it in its own diſpoſal whilſt it hath theſe Touches, but both doth and muſt ſee, and think, only what his Divine Majeſty will have it; and this only ſo long as he pleaſeth. Nor can any of theſe things by any Art or Induſtry of the Soul be attained or procured when ſhe will, but all is Supernatural, and as well above the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of <hi>common Grace</hi> in us, as of <hi>Reaſon.</hi> In which Supernatural and Extraordinary Divine Impreſſions upon the Soul, the Experienced alſo obſerve two ſorts of Motions in it: Either a very intimate <hi>Retreat</hi> and <hi>Recollection</hi> of the Soul from Exterior Objects, as it were into ſome interior part of it ſelf, removed from the Thoughts or Remembrace of Creatures or Worldly things; which is often joyned with a Retiring alſo of the Vital Spirits, more or leſs, from the outward parts of the Body left ſometimes in ſuch Recollection without Senſe, Motion, or Heat. <hi>Alienatio Mentis à Senſibus Corporis,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> (in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:192035:180"/>
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67.) calls it, <hi>ut Spiritui quod demonſtrandum est demonſtretur.</hi> Such perhaps was that Extaſie of St. <hi>John,</hi> when he is ſaid to have been in the Spirit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. Or, 2. an <hi>Elevation, Rapt,</hi> or <hi>Flight</hi> of the Soul as it were above it ſelf, and as if it were to depart preſently out of the Body, and the Perſon to ſuffer a preſent Diſſolution. <hi>Avolatio Mentis,</hi> as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> expreſſeth it. Such ſeems that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. §. 29.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things are not handled as <hi>Rules of Devotion,</hi> but as a Reward of it; and as things only in God's, not our Power. Yet are theſe Rich Gifts of God and Preguſtations of the State in the World to come recommended to ſignifie the many noble Effects and powerful Influences, which ſuch Favours have upon thoſe who receive them, as to the compleating them in all Chriſtian Perfection; that is, in the perfect Love of God; all theſe Divine Inactions tending ſtill to a clearer Manifeſtation of God to the Soul, and ſo to the wounding it more deeply with the Love and Longing after him, and after the Suffering and Doing any thing with all Alacrity for him; and the Graces that are received diſpoſing us ſtill to others higher, if the Soul correſpond to them as ſhe ought. <hi>If I perſevere</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Bernard</hi> (in <hi>Cant.</hi> Serm. 69.) ſpeaking of theſe Favours) <hi>to correſpond to this Condeſcention, as much as I can, with meet Affections and Actions, and the Grace of God be not in vain in me, the Father and the Son will ever make their Abode with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are alſo told, That, though upon no Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Prediſpoſitions in us, whatever ſuch Favours do neceſſarily follow, yet without theſe God doth not uſually grant them: That Active Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation is the ready way to Paſſive; and, That
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:192035:180"/>though in the higher degrees of them they are but rare, and given to few, yet in ſome inferior degree they are communicated to many: and however, That an Active Contemplation and Fruition of God by Love, (ſpoken of before) and the Great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement in all Chriſtian Vertue gain'd thereby, (if we be admitted to no higher things, of which true Humility always eſteems its ſelf unworthy) is a ſufficient Recompence in this World for any Pains of ours in Purging of our Life, and cloſe Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God in <hi>Solitude</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſince ſuch Chriſtian Perfection chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in, and depends upon the Exerciſe of the Affective part of the Soul, and not on high Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Speculation, therefore it is recommended as attainable by all Sexes and Conditions, and all are equally encouraged in the Proſecution of it. <hi>For the Grace of Contemplation,</hi> as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> obſerves, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> hom. 17. <hi>is not given to the high, and not given to the low; but this do often the highest, and often the lowest; more often thoſe who are remote, that is, from Worldly Cares, but ſometimes thoſe who are in a Married State receive.</hi> §. 30, 31.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>More of this he hath afterward, which I ſhall here add, as followeth:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the Steps, in order to the higheſt State of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which this Life arrives to, mentioned in <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> p. 32. 1. The firſt, is the way of <hi>External and Imaginary Exerciſes of Prayer;</hi> that is, uſing the Diſcourſe of the Underſtanding, and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,</hi> as alſo <hi>Vocal Prayer;</hi> then which Step, <hi>Sancta Sophia</hi> obſerves, many go no further, but end their days in it; that is, in ſuch <hi>Meditations</hi> is taken up the moſt part of their Devotions.</p>

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:192035:181"/> 2. The ſecond Step is, <hi>the Exerciſe of the Will and Affections,</hi> which, after long practice, breaks forth into continual <hi>Aſpirations</hi> and <hi>Elevations</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Third, is, <hi>Divine Inaction,</hi> or the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and ſupernatural, and more ſenſible Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of God's Spirit in the Soul, wherein God acteth more than ſhe, and which are not in her power at all to procure ſooner, or retain longer, then God pleaſeth: of which much hath been ſaid before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. After which uſually, in the Intervals of theſe Coeleſtial Viſits, do follow great <hi>Deſolations</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as the Experienced have deſcribed them; partly ariſing from the ſenſe of her Loſs, and an impatient longing after theſe Favours, once taſted; and partly out of a great nauſeating, and diſreliſh that ſhe hath now of thoſe entertainments of the Creature, from which ſhe formerly received ſome Content.

                     </gap> Naturals, and as if he were quite departed from it in great Aridity, Obſcurity, Solitude, Preſſure and Heavineſs, diſguſted with all things, ſhe knows not why; performing ſtill her Devotions, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed Duties of Piety, and the Service of God, as formerly, but without any ſenſible comfort in ſuch
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:192035:181"/>Performance; Meditation, Aſpiration, Reading, very difficult, ſterile, inſipid, and ſeeming without Fruit; only forbearing her Conſent to any Sin, Vanity, or Senſuality, and not ſeeking any ſecular Conſolations. Much diſcouraged alſo at ſuch times many are, in imagining, that God hath ſo deſerted them, for Failings in their Duty, or for ſomething wherein they have offended his Divine Majeſty, which doubles this Anguiſh. Or, if not this, at leaſt they imagin it to be cauſed by ſome great Indiſpoſition of Body, (as it is granted ſometimes partly it may) ſo as ſome begin therefore to diſpenſe for a time with the former Exerciſes of their Devotion, and other pious Employments. But notwithſtanding many times in theſe, the poor Soul is miſtaken; and this ſtrange dejection of Spirit comes, without any ſuch reſpects, meerly from the ſole Will of God, and is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of his proceeding with thoſe alſo, who are by his former Graces well grounded, and arrived to ſome degree of Perfection, and is ſent only for their much greater Advancement therein, and the rendring them more capable of higher Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; and therefore ought, as ſuch, to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with all Equanimity, Patience, Reſignation, and Conformity to his Will.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Conſolations</hi> and <hi>Deſolations</hi> take, as it were, their certain turns in them, as they do, in a leſſer degree, in all the Regenerate; they have by courſe a Day, and a Night; an Aſcent towards God, and a Deſcent, and decadence into themſelves; a Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by and in him, and a Mortification in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; a Summer, wherein the Branches ſhoot forth, and Fruit comes to Maturity; and a Winter, when the Root ſpreads more, and the Tree becomes more ſurely fixed. To all God's Children do theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:192035:182"/>happen; but theſe in a higher degree to the further advanced in Perfection; and the greateſt Favours are preceeded with greater Deſolations; and theſe ordinarily proportioned one to the other. And always neceſſary, leſs or more, are ſuch Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and Refinings of the Soul by theſe interior Croſſes, becauſe always ſomething in them is amiſs and as yet imperfect. Our natural Corruption is ſtill producing ſomething in us to be amended; and ſome Self-will and Self-love to be parted away by this ſharp Remedy, whilſt we are in this Life. And the <hi>Benefit</hi> of theſe <hi>Deſolations,</hi> if rightly complied with, as well as of Divine <hi>Conſolations,</hi> is very great in many reſpects. §. 64.</p>
                  <p>For herein it is, that the Soul comes moſt perfectly to know it ſelf, and all other Creatures; to ſee it own Nothingneſs, and to be moſt perfectly purged and cleanſed from all Self-love and Propriety: and herein it is moſt eſpecially taught — <hi>non quieſcere i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet theſe Deſolations alſo, in a Soul thus far advanced in Grace, are not void of a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Joy and Satisfaction, that it hath always in God's Will being performed in them; which <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God</hi> now, in whatever happens, is a conſtant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to it; and the Apoſtles Precept, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.16, 17. of <hi>Semper gaudete,</hi> is thus accompliſhed in ſuch a Soul, as well as his <hi>orate ſine intermiſſione;</hi> and go together. For there cannot want Content, where the Mind hath its Deſire; nor doth ſuch a Mind want this that is unanimous with the Divine Will: the want of which Conformity, is only from the loving of ſomething that is againſt his Will. Worldly Sorrows, ſaith St. <hi>Gregory, affligentes cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciant;</hi> but theſe Spiritual, <hi>reficiunt dum affligunt.</hi> In the one is, <hi>In afflictione maeror;</hi> but in the other, <hi>In merore laetitia,</hi> Moral. l. 23. c. 13. Nay, more true Sweetneſs in theſe Sorrows, than in the other Joys: And the abſtaining in ſuch a ſharp Tryal from all Sin againſt God, or ſeeking Comfort from any thing beſides Him, or giving over her accuſtomed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:192035:183"/>Exerciſes of Piety, argues alſo then a cloſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of the Soul with God, though not ſo ſenſible; and that when it thinks it ſelf fartheſt from him, it is in ſome ſort neareſt to him. Laſtly, by and upon theſe Spiritual Deſolations ordinarily it is, that the Soul afterward receives higher ſenſible Viſits, and Careſſes from God, then any former were; for which the Soul ſeems beſt prepared by this her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Poverty and Lowneſs; and then it is, if ever, the Soul receives them with more Gratitude; and both highlier values them, and villifies its ſelf. And it is God's ordinary way to exalt us in proportion to our Humility, and to be <hi>Adjutor in tribulationibus,</hi> as <hi>in opportunitatibus,</hi> when alſo the Soul is more endeared unto him by her Sufferings. All this I have ſaid, to ſhew that theſe Spiritual Deſolations (of which this Author Ironically ſaith, Then, when one would leaſt expect them, follow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are a neceſſary part of the <hi>Way to Perfection;</hi> and that the reſiſtance of ſuch Preſſures when they come, or a non-compliance with them in ſhewing much Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation and Impatience, in ſeeking to relieve ſuch Spiritual Deſertions with ſome ſecular Contents, in relaxing former Holy Practices, and the like, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoints the Soul of thoſe following Conſolations, which are the proper Reward of theſe Sufferings, and diſturbs God's Work in her, and good Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions toward her; and hinders her Growth in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, by her retaining ſtill thoſe <hi>Imperfections,</hi> and that <hi>Self-love,</hi> which theſe, rightly received, would have purged and mortified. This of the fourth Step to Perfection, <hi>Deſolation.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. The Fifth, is a State more ſettled, conſtant, and tranquil, where neither theſe Deſolations are ſo fequent or neceſſary; nor thoſe Coeleſtial Viſits ſo violent, or ſo ſhort. §. 65.</p>

                     <hi>To theſe I ſhall add two or three of his Anſwers, to Objections and Cavils, ſuch as I think most pertinent for Common uſe: and first, whereas upon the first Step his Adverſary deſcants thus: <q>A ſad Caſe to end our days as Christ and his Apoſtles did, who uſed this low diſpenſation of Praying to the last. But, alas! they never underſtood theſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions with God in the Fund of the Spirit; they taught Men a plain and intelligible way of Serving God, and bid them look for Perfection in another World.</q>
                     </hi> To this he replies;</p>
                  <p>I ask, Did our Lord and his Apoſtles end their days only, or chiefly, in the firſt Step here, that of <hi>Meditation,</hi> and <hi>Diſcurſive</hi> or <hi>Vocal Prayer,</hi> and never aſcend to the ſecond Step, exerciſing more therein the Will and Affections in Aſpirations, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of the Soul to God? What think we of the moſt exalted Diſciple St. <hi>John,</hi> every where diſcourſing ſo much of <hi>Love?</hi> and of our dwelling, by Love, in God, and God in us? 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.16. What of thoſe Precepts, <hi>Pray without ceaſing,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.17. <hi>Watch and pray always,</hi> Luk. 21.36. <hi>And with all Perſeverance therein?</hi> Eph. 6.18. Are theſe to be underſtood only of <hi>Vocal</hi> and <hi>diſcurſive Prayer,</hi> the firſt Step; or not rather of <hi>Effective Prayer,</hi> the ſecond; (according to that, <hi>Qui ſemper deſiderat ſemper orat;</hi>) which latter is alſo much eaſier to be continued? Again; What think we of our Lord's ſpending ſo long time in Prayer, often mentioned in the Goſpels? <hi>Riſing up a great while before day,</hi> for this purpoſe, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.35. Again; <hi>retiring into the Wilderneſs,</hi> for a great vacancy to it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.16. Before the day of the Election of his twelve Apoſtles, (the twelve Foundations of his Church) aſcending into a ſolitary Mountain, and there ſpending the whole Night in Prayer, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.13. His
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:192035:184"/>aſcending again into another Mountain, before he took his laſt Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of his Paſſion, taking three of his Diſciples with him, where all the Night again was ſpent in Prayer; for it is ſaid, he deſcended not from the Hill till the next day: and that there the three Diſciples were ſurpriſed with Sleep, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.37, 32. In which Prayer they ſaw his Countenance changed, and an anticipated appearance of his Glory, ſuch as he ſhall have when he comes to Judgment, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. and an Apparition alſo of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> they by a ſupernatural Illumination knowing alſo who the Perſons were, <hi>Matt.</hi> 16.28. and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple <hi>Peter</hi> in ſuch an Extatick Joy, as that he cryed out, <hi>Bonum est eſſe hic,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.33. not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaith the Evangeliſt, what he ſaid. So, in our Lord's being in Prayer, preſently after <hi>John</hi>'s Baptizing him happened the Viſion of the Heavens opened, the Holy Ghoſt deſcending upon him in a Bodily ſhape like a Dove, ſeen by the Baptiſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.21, 22. and a Voice from Heaven ſpeaking to him, as here, <hi>Thou art my beloved Son,</hi> Luk. 9.35. And then a Rapt of the ſame Spirit that carried him into the Deſart; where alſo we may rationally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his time to have been wholly ſpent in Prayer and Devotion, and this in ſuch a degree, as to ſuſpend and ſupercede the ordinary Functions of Nature, as to Eating and Drinking; and in theſe his Prayers the Tempter to have aſſaulted him. What think we again of our Lord's <hi>Infremuit Spiritu,</hi> once and again, in his Prayer to his Father for the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of <hi>Lazarus?</hi> Joh. 11.33, 38. of the raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Expreſſions of his Love, and tender Affection, and Aſpirations after a perfect Union of all his with Him, and his Father, in his Prayer after his laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,

What think we again of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Extatical Prayer, and his Viſion on <hi>Simon</hi> the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Houſe-top, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.9. and again, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s in the Temple, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whilſt I prayed, I was in an Extaſie,</hi> &amp;c?

But then <hi>are Paſſive <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions the obſcure and unintelligible way of Serving God,</hi> that the Church teacheth in her Rules of Devotion; or, the end rather which her plain and intelligible way ſometimes attains to? Laſtly, Is there not in ſome ſort a State of <hi>Perfection</hi> alſo in this World? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. <hi>we ſpeak Wiſdom among the Perfect.</hi> And <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. <hi>let us, as many as be perfect, be thus minded.</hi> And <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.40. <hi>Every one that is perfect, ſhall be as his Maſter,</hi> (that is, in Sufferings like him.) The Author may do well to review this paſſage of his. §. 66.</p>
                  <p>The repairing to <hi>Prayer,</hi> in the beſt manner we can make it, is a <hi>proper, natural, and most efficacious way to obtain a ſupernatural Light</hi> (from God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) <hi>to diſcern his Will</hi> in all our Actions; ſpeaking of ſuch as are indifferent, and ſuch wherein neither we, nor any others, have any external certain Rule,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:192035:185"/>all Circumſtances conſidered, whereby we may be guided, as we have in all ſuch other Actions, the Lawfulneſs of which is doubted of; which yet is not ſaid, as if <hi>Prayer</hi> were the only means of our dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in theſe, ſo as to exclude the making uſe of either our own Reaſon, or other Mens Advice, as is ſaid before. §. 76.</p>
                  <p>This is not making <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> but <hi>Prayer,</hi> a means to obtain the Illuminations of God's Spirit, to ſhew us, in two things ſuggeſted to us, which of them comes from It, or which is more conformable to God's Will, that ſo we may follow and obey it: and, What a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is he, that being doubtful, eſpecially in two aſſairs of much concernment, which to make choice of, doth not retire to his <hi>Prayers,</hi> deſiring God to direct him in ſuch a particular, and promiſing to do that which he ſhall be pleaſed, by any way, to ſignifie to him to be more conformable to his Will, and more conducing to Chriſtian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, (as certainly the one may be much more than the other, although both contained within the general bounds of Good, or indifferent?) And then, what <hi>Illumination</hi> he Prays for, why may not he alſo expect? Again, Who is there, much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting <hi>Prayer,</hi> that doth not perceive in them ſome Illuſtrations and Influences entring, and injected as it were into his Mind, without his own procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, touching a more perfect knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; or the immenſe Love of God to Mankind; or ſome acceptable Service he may do to God or his Neighbour; or ſecret Reprehenſions for ſome Faults; or Admonitions for the better ordering of his Life; <hi>Spiritu</hi> (as our Lord ſaith, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.8.) <hi>Spirante ubi vult,</hi> and he not knowing whence ſuch things come, or how they paſs away? yet theſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:192035:185"/>things, we are aſſured, muſt be from God's Spirit, becauſe no <hi>good Thought</hi> is from our ſelves. And why may not we imagin the ſame (a due Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being ſuppoſed) of the Thoughts injected in our Doubtings, and Requeſts concerning Actions left free, and undetermined by the Divine declared Will, what way in theſe we may rather take, the better to ſerve and pleaſe him? God forbid that the Name of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> ſhould deterr Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from ſuch a Practice, or hearkening to this internal Language; or (as Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> expreſſes it in his <hi>Preface</hi>) <hi>ſhould render Prayer, and by Prayer the obtaining of Divine Grace, a ſuſpicious Exerciſe.</hi> And I wiſh the Author would a little better weigh his Words, and the malign Influence they may have on others. We ſay then, <hi>Divine Inſpirations</hi> are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary (for Grace, as well <hi>furthers</hi> as <hi>prevents</hi> us) to diſtinguiſh the Motions of the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> in our Minds in matters purely indifferent, (which may be propoſed to us by either of theſe Spirits, for a different end,) where we have no other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Rule</hi> to judge theſe <hi>Motions</hi> by, as we have in all internal Suggeſtions concerning ſuch other matters as are either directly commanded or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by God's Law.</p>

                     </hi> ridiculed it; (<hi>v. Soc. Hiſt. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 23.) but a Spirit of Antichriſt, and of Satan transformed as appears moſt manifeſtly in <hi>Porphyry,</hi> who was a Renagado, and Apoſtate from Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; and that not upon any Grounds of Reaſon, but upon Paſſion for ſome Reproof, as <hi>Valeſius</hi> underſtands it; or ſome more ſevere Diſcipline, he received from ſome Chriſtians poſſibly for ſome abuſe by <hi>Scoffing,</hi> to which he was much addicted; and thereupon became not only an Apoſtate, but a ſpiteful Adverſary, and the more impudent, through the Countenance of the Emperor <hi>Julian,</hi> who was alſo an Apoſtate, and ſuch another Scoffer. This might be abundantly ſhewed, if it was needful here, and may be upon ſome other occaſion: but this is ſufficient for this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:192035:187"/>And this may ſerve for another purpoſe, in reſpect of the <hi>Quakers; viz.</hi> to undeceive them, and let them ſee plainly by what Spirit they have been deceived, even this very Antichriſtian <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrian</hi> Spirit, and no better. <hi>The Spirit,</hi> I doubt not, is the very ſame, or of the ſame kind, only <hi>the Appearance</hi> is ſomewhat different, more bare-faced then, upon the Encouragement of an Apoſtate Emperor; but more covert now in this, being a Chriſtian State. But as that ſoon ceaſed, ſo will this, I am well ſatisfied, to the Shame and Confuſion of thoſe, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately perſiſt in their Errors; but eſpecially thoſe, who not only are deceived, but preſume to take upon them to be <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Chriſt, and deceive others; when it ſhall appear that they are only Miniſters of this <hi>Porphyrian</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Spirit, that is, of Satan transformed; as I nothing doubt but it will in due time, and that ere long, by undeniable Moral Evidence, if not alſo by manifeſt Divine Vengeance upon ſome of the Obſtinate; which I have ſincerely endeavoured to prevent; and ſhould ſtill be glad to help them out, if they would humble themſelves, and give Glory to God, as their Caſe doth require: otherwiſe they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be called to account for neglected Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Favours.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>the Gentile Diſpenſation,</hi> there is plainly a Fallacy concerning it put upon them by the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:192035:188"/>Subtilty and Fraud of that Spirit, which acts ſo ſenſibly amongſt them. For as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were choſen to be, as it were, of God's own Regiment, and are therefore call'd his Peculiar people; yet were they, for their Sin, delivered over to the Conduct of an Angel, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. ſo were other Nations committed to the Conduct of certain Angels, probably of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Orders. And as the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> after they were ſettled in the Promiſed Land, under the immediate Government of God, (<hi>v. Sam.</hi> 8.7.) were often, notwithſtanding, for their Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings and Tranſgreſſions, delivered into the hands of their Enemies, (which was plainly a Repreſentation of Spiritual matters:) ſo the other Nations, though they were committed at firſt to the Regiment of Good Angels, though of an inferior order, yet when they came to yield to the Inſpirations of Apoſtate Spirits, (which was a real, though Spiritual Fornication and Defilement) were left in theirPower to be abuſed, and ridden, and led Captive by them at their pleaſure. And thoſe who continued under their Conduct to the laſt, without Repentance, are like to have their part with them hereafter. And this is <hi>the Myſtery of Iniquity whereby theſe People are impoſed upon</hi> by the Subtilty of this <hi>Porphyrian</hi> Spirit. For,</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>twofold Gentile Diſpenſation,</hi> or <hi>two parts of the Gentile Diſpenſation;</hi> the one of <hi>Grace,</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:192035:188"/>under the Good Angel, which is God's Deputy; the other of <hi>Judgment,</hi> under the Apoſtate Spirit, which is God's Executioner of Vengeance. And this is it, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Seduced by the Spirit of Antichriſt, that God ſhould ſend them ſtrong Deluſions to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Lye, becauſe they received not the Love of the Truth; that they all might be damned who believe not the Truth. Now, whatever become of the reſt, who have not the Favour of the Goſpel communicated to them, but yet deſert not the Conduct of the Spirit, by God ſet over them; yet thoſe who have the Goſpel in all Simplicity offered to them, and either through Pride and Conceitedneſs, or through the Inſpiration of any Spirit, are drawn from it, their Caſe is very dangerous: for no Good Spirit would dare, or would offer any ſuch thing: and then it muſt needs be ſome wicked Spirit in diſguiſe, how ſpecious ſoever his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance be, which for ſome Spiritual Sin, at leaſt, if not Carnal or Worldly, in them or their Parents, hath gotten Advantage of them: And ſuch are very officious to offer themſelves, and very ſubtile to deceive: And their Neglect of the Offers of Grace is like to prove fatal to them. But none are in greater danger than they, who are ſo unhappy as to become the Agents and Miniſters of ſuch a Spirit, whatever they may think of themſelves at preſent.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:192035:189"/>
                  <p> This, I hope, may ſerve for this Occaſion; but having for divers Months paſt been endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, by private Conferences with, and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to, the Chief of their Miniſters, to ſet this People right, in what they are out of the way, I intend ere long, if no leſs will ſerve, by the Grace of God, to diſcourſe theſe matters more fully at ſome publick Meetings, upon ſufficient Notice, and there to give a true <hi>Account of my Proceedings with them</hi> hitherto, and to diſcourſe <hi>the Great Queſtion</hi> now depending between us:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What that Spirit is, by which the Party hath been generally and principally acted and conducted? Whether the Spirit of Chriſt, or any Good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring Spirit; or the Spirit of Antichriſt, or ſome Porphyrian or Apoſtate Spirit?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the mean time I only recommend this Advertiſement to all, That the Holy Scriptures and the beſt Spiritual Writers give great Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to beware of <hi>falſe Spirits,</hi> and Directions to <hi>Try the Spirits:</hi> and if the <hi>Leaders</hi> of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> do not ſo, they are the more to be ſuſpected; alſo, That it is commonly agreed by ſuch Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that there is often much Deceit and Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Seducing Spirits,</hi> in ſeeming Illuminations, and Senſible Impreſſions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations.

                     <q>THE <hi>Magnet</hi> hath not only its intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, active Principle, its Form from which its Motions proceed; but there is alſo a common Magnetiſm of the Earth and its Effluxes, that greatly aſſiſt, excite, and direct its Motions.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Animals and Vegetables</hi> have not only their intrinſick, ſpecifical, vital Principles of their ſpecifical Motions and Operations, but the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:192035:191"/>Sun and its Heat and Influence is an univerſal, adjuvant, exciting Principle of all vital and ſentient Operations.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And not only the ancient Philoſophers, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and their ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators, as <hi>Simplicius, Themiſtius, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Aphrodiceus, Avicen,</hi> and <hi>Averroes,</hi> but alſo the Jewiſh Doctors, and the Chriſtian Philoſophers and Divines for ſome Ages after Chriſt, did think, that, beſides the individual intellectual Soul of every Man, there was alſo a certain <hi>Common Intelligent Nature,</hi> or Being, ſubſtituted by Almighty God, whoſe Office it was to illuminate the humane Soul, to excite actual Intellection in it, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto it theſe common intellectual Principles, which ordinarily and generally obtain in all Men, and ſtood in relation to the humane Intellectual Soul, as the Sun and its Light and Influence ſtands in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to vital Natures in the Lower World: And this they call <hi>Intellectus Agens,</hi> which <hi>Averroes</hi> ſuppoſeth to be <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltima Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiarum ſeparatarum,</hi> and deputed to the actuating and exciting of Intellection in Men.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>This Opinion hath been (poſſibly upon Reaſons probable enough) laid aſide for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages in the Chriſtian Church: the Uſe therefore that I make of it only is this, That
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:192035:191"/>though this Opinion ſeems to be dark and obſcure, and not bottom'd upon a clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, yet it carries with it and under it an Adumbration of a great and real Truth, though they attained not a full, clear, diſtinct diſcovery of it: Therefore as the Apoſtle elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in another Caſe told the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that that God, whom they ignorantly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, <hi>Him declare I unto you,</hi> Acts 17.23. ſo, with ſome variation, I may with humility ſay, that ſecret, unſeen, and ſpiritual Power, which theſe ancient Philoſophers did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly underſtand, but groped after it, and celebrated by the Name of <hi>Intellectus Agens,</hi> I am now endeavouring to declare.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Almighty GOD, as he is every where by his Eſſential Preſence, ſo he is every where by his Powerful Influence; and as he is the Univerſal Productive and Conſerving Cauſe of all things in the World, ſo he is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate unto, and effective of every thing in the World by his Efficacious Influence, than any ſecond created Cauſe in the World; for they are all but his Inſtruments, and therefore their Cauſality is ſtill but in and from the Virtue and Influence of the firſt Cauſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And this Influx of the Firſt Cauſe, the prime Efficient, Almighty God, is by him ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily communicated, effuſed, and proportioned
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:192035:192"/>according to the ſeveral Natures of Created Beings; though, according to his wiſe good Pleaſure, he ſometimes is pleaſed to do it in a different manner for excellent Ends, <hi>pro Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio Voluntatis.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And therefore in Matters that are <hi>ſimply natural,</hi> this ordinary Efflux of the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is ſuited to that common Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he hath ſettled in the World, and governs ſuch things according to thoſe inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, regular, natural Laws.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>But unto an <hi>Intellectual Nature,</hi> ſuch as is that of Man, endued with Underſtanding and Will, this Divine Efflux is communicated in a kind proportionable to thoſe Faculties of the humane Soul; and therefore theſe Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes of the Divine Influence are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated <hi>in two kinds:</hi> 1. By way of <hi>Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> in relation to the Underſtanding Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. 2. By way of Perſuaſion, <hi>Inclination,</hi> and Incitation, in relation to the Will and Affections, although there are <hi>many other kind of Effluxes</hi> of the Divine Spirit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence: as the Gift of <hi>bodily Strength,</hi> as that of <hi>Samſon, Judges</hi> 16.20. the Gift of <hi>curious Workmanſhip,</hi> as that of <hi>Aholiab,</hi> and <hi>Beſaliel, Exod.</hi> 36.1. the Spirit of <hi>Majeſty and Government,</hi> as that of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.9. the Gifts of <hi>Propheſying, Tongues, Miracles,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 9. for theſe were extraordinary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:192035:192"/>Effluxes given out upon ſpecial Occaſions, and for ſpecial Ends, though even in moſt of them, and other extraordinary Gifts of the like nature, the Underſtanding and Will were much concerned and wrought upon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <q>1. As to the <hi>Illumination of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> certainly what the Sun is to the ſentient Eye, that, and much more, is Almighty God to the Mind of Man: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9. <hi>In thy Light ſhall we ſee Light.</hi> John 1.9. <hi>This is the true Light that enlightneth every Man that cometh into the World.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <q>2. As to the <hi>Inclination</hi> and <hi>Bending of the Will,</hi> it is true, the Will is naturally free, but yet it is eſſentially ſubject unto the God that made it; and the operation of the Divine Influence upon the Will ordinarily is but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive, and therefore ordinarily reſiſtible: thus the old World reſiſted the merciful ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Divine Influence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man.</hi> Acts 7.51. <hi>Ye always reſist the Holy Ghost:</hi> but the Powerful God hath ſo great an Efficacy, and hath ſo intimate an acceſs into the Minds of Men, that he can when he pleaſeth, and doubtleſs ſometimes doth, irreſiſtibly bend and incline the Will unto himſelf, according to his good Pleaſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be willing in the day of thy Power.</hi> It
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:192035:193"/>is an excellent Expreſſion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.1. <hi>The Heart of the King is in the Hands of the Lord, as the Rivers of Water he turneth it whitherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will.</hi> A good Artiſt will guide a Stream of Water to what place, and in what manner, he pleaſeth, in the ſame Level, and yet without any violence offered to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Motion of the Water, which in all thoſe Motions is kept entirely ſuitable to its Nature: And with the ſame and much greater facility the God of Heaven can, and often doth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly Guide the Hearts of Men, yea, of Kings, and yet without Force or Violation of its natural Liberty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>There was <hi>never any Age nor People</hi> in the World that was <hi>wholly deſtitute of this Divine Efflux</hi> upon their Underſtandings and Wills: it is as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal and Common</hi> as the Light and Influence of the Heavens; only upon ſome in all Ages it was more ſpecial and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual than upon others, even in the Gentile World. I have always eſteemed thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Men among <hi>the Heathen</hi> famous for Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Juſtice, Piety, and Knowledge, as Men illuminated and guided by this Divine Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though poſſibly communicated to them in a more ſignal manner than to other Men: Such were <hi>Socrates, Plato, Zeno Citticus, Solon, Lycurgus, Pythagoras, Tully, Seneca, Ariſtotle,</hi> and divers other excellent Philoſophers,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192035:193"/>Moraliſts, and Law-givers, among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; who were by the Influence of the Divine Spirit excited, illuminated, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed for the Benefit of themſelves and the reſt of Mankind, and to prepare the Heathen World for the Reception of greater Light.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>When it pleaſed God to ſelect unto himſelf and his ſpecial Government, the Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Deſcendants, <hi>the Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he ſets them in <hi>the middle of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable World,</hi> like a Beacon upon a Hill, to be a kind of Common Inſtruction to the reſt of Mankind; and for that purpoſe, made them ſignal to all the World by his ſpecial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over them, by Miracles, Signs and Wonders; by giving them Laws from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in great Majeſty and Terrour; by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to them the Divine Oracles; by raiſing up Prophets and Men ſpecially inſpired by an Extraordinary Spirit, and by effuſing among them a greater Meaſure of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his Sacred Spirit. For (that I may ſay it once for all) it hath been always the Method of the Divine Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when he ſends out the greater Meaſure of this Influx, whereof I ſpeak, the Divine Providence accompanies that Efflux with ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able external Means to render it the more effectual, and the more agreeable to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:192035:194"/>of the Reception of the humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: But when <hi>the Meſſias</hi> came into the World with the Meſſage of the Glorious Goſpel, the Sun was as it were in its Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian; and as the means of Illumination and Converſion of the World unto God was more effectual and univerſal, ſo was alſo the Efflux and Irradiation of the Divine Influence upon the Souls of Men more vigorous, diffuſive, and univerſal.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And as the miraculous <hi>Gifts</hi> of the Spirit of God appeared in the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the Gifts of Tongues, of Healing Diſeaſes, of Prophecy, and the like, to confirm and eſtabliſh Mens Minds in the Faith, Belief, and Obedience of the Goſpel; ſo neither was this all: but the <hi>ſecret and effectual Influence</hi> of the ſame Bleſſed Spirit appeared in Illumination of the Minds of Men, in perſuading and mightily ſubduing their Wills to the Belief and Obedience of the Truth, in converting Mens Minds unto God, and placing them in thei juſt and due Habitude to Almighty God. And this, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various Workings thereof, is ſometimes called the Spirit of Regeneration, the Spirit of Renovation, the Spirit of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, the Spirit of Holineſs, the Spirit of Adoption, the Spirit of Prayer and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the Spirit of Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:192035:194"/>the various Energies that this great Effuſion of the Influences of the Bleſſed Spirit had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Minds of Men.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And this great and more diffuſive and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Effuſion of this Influence under the Goſpel was no other than what was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of by the ancient Prophets, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.7. <hi>I will deſtroy in this Mountain, the covering cast upon the Face of all People.</hi> Iſa. 11.9. <hi>The Earth ſhall be filled with the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea.</hi> Iſa. 54.13. <hi>All thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord.</hi> Iſa. 59.20. <hi>This is my Covenant that I will make with them, my Spirit, that is upon thee, and the Words which I have put in thy Mouth, ſhall not depart from thee, nor from thy Seed, nor from thy Seeds Seed.</hi> Ezek. 36.27. <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and keep my Judgments, and do them.</hi> Iſa. 44.3. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon thy Seed.</hi> Joel 2.28. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fleſh.</hi> And this Energy of the Divine Influence appears, 1. By a ſecret Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation and <hi>Illumination</hi> of the Underſtanding. 2. By a powerful Perſuaſion and <hi>Inclining</hi> of the Will; both which, as they were with a more vigorous and effectual Diſpenſation under the firſt breaking out of the Light of the Goſpel, ſo they do accompany the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it unto this day, and ſhall unto the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:192035:195"/>end of the World; though by reaſon of the Corruption of the Lives and Manners of Mankind, not with equal Succeſs in all Ages.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have here the <hi>Judgment</hi> and Belief of this Great and Good Man of a <hi>Divine Efflux</hi> upon the Underſtandings and Wills of Men, and that even among the Heathen, thoſe ſo famed for <hi>Wiſdom, Juſtice, Piety,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> were Illuminated and Guided by a Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. And we have here alſo the <hi>Ground</hi> of this his Judgment. 1. <hi>Obſervations</hi> in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 2. The <hi>Sentiments</hi> of Learned and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Men, Philoſophers in all Ages. 3. The <hi>Authority</hi> of the Sacred Scriptures; to which, he elſewhere adds his own Experience. And whereas he had in ſome things changed his Opinion, as he ſaw cauſe, from what it was in his younger time, this he received early, as appears by ſome of his Firſt Writings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd conſtantly to the laſt, as appears by his <hi>Treatiſe of Humility,</hi> which he wrote upon my Motion, not long before his laſt Sickneſs.</p>
                  <p>In his <hi>Treatiſe of Wiſdom, and the Fear of God,</hi> after other particulars of the Wiſdom of the Fear of God, he adds, in the <hi>10th</hi> place: <hi>But beſides all this, there is yet a Secret but a most Certain Truth, that highly improveth that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which the Fear of the Lord bringeth, and that is this, That thoſe that truly fear God have</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:192035:195"/>a Secret Guidance <hi>from a higher Wiſdom, than what is barely Humane; namely,</hi> by the Spirit of Truth and Wiſdom, <hi>that doth really and truly, but ſecretly prevent and direct them. And let no Man think that this is a piece of</hi> Fanaticiſm. <hi>Any Man that ſincerely and truly fears Almighty God, relies upon Him, calls upon Him for his Guidance and Direction, hath it as really as the Son hath the Counſel and Direction of his Father: and though the Voice be not audible, nor the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> always <hi>perceptible to Senſe, yet it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually as real as if a Man heard the Voice ſaying,</hi> This is the Way, walk in it. <hi>And this Secret Direction of Almighty God is</hi> principally <hi>ſeen in Matters relating to the Good of the Soul: but it may</hi> alſo <hi>be found in the Great and Momentous Concerns of this Life, which a Good Man, that fears God, and begs his Direction, ſhall very often, if not at all times, find.</hi> And in his <hi>Treatiſe of Humility,</hi> ſpeaking of this Guidance and Direction of Almighty God, in relation to a double End; 1. The Salvation and Happineſs of the Soul. 2. In all the Walk and Concern of this Life; as to this latter he ſaith; <hi>The Air doth not more naturally yield to our Attraction in Reſpiration, or to inſinuate it ſelf into thoſe ſpaces that are receptive of it, than the Divine Aſſiſtance, Guidance, and Beneficence doth to the Deſires, Exigencies, and Wants of an humble Soul, ſenſible of its own Emptineſs and Deficiency,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:192035:196"/>and implering the Direction, Guidance, and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the most Wiſe and Bountiful God.</hi> And then adds, <hi>I can call</hi> my own Experience <hi>to witneſs, that even in the External Actions, Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and Incidences of my whole Life, I was never diſappointed of</hi> the beſt Guidance and Direction, <hi>when in Humility and Senſe of my own Deficiency, and diffidence of my own Ability to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect my ſelf, or to grapple with the Difficulties of my Life, I have, with Humility and Sincerity, implored the Secret Direction and Guidance of the Divine Wiſdom and Providence.</hi> This he ſpeaks of the ſecret Guidance by the Spirit of Truth, by <hi>Illumination</hi> of the Underſtanding, and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi> of the Will; but there is another Secret Guidance by a <hi>Providential</hi> Diſpoſal of Occurrences, which he doth not here exclude, yet ſeems more eſpecially to intend, when he afterward appeals to the Experience of others.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo obſerved, as well from what he hath ſaid upon ſeveral Occaſions, as from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Paſſages in his Writings, that he had from his younger time, in all his Life, not only a great reſpect to this ſecret Guidance of the Spirit of God, but alſo ſo great a Senſe of the Malice, Subtlety, and Energy of the Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as made him very vigilant againſt them. And I doubt not but his conſtant and reverend Attendance to that Holy Conduct, and his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:192035:196"/>Vigilance againſt the Wiles and Devices of thoſe inviſible Enemies, were a principal Means whereby he became ſo Great and Good a Man as he was.</p>
                  <p>This is <hi>genuine Chriſtianity,</hi> and therefore it cannot but move Indignation in the Hearts of True Chriſtians, to ſee ſo Great and Noble a Principle of their Religion to be ſo unworthily expos'd, contemned and reproached, as this hath been in our Times, partly by ſenſual Bruits, partly by conceited animal Pretenders to Reaſon, and partly by inconſiderate Oppoſers of Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm. Nay, it is a Principle not peculiar to the times of the Incarnation of the Eternal <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi> and ſucceeding Ages, but made manifeſt by that Light which enlighteneth every Man that cometh into the World, unto all pious and virtuous Souls from the beginning: and it is a dangerous ſign of an empty, bewidowed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted Soul, for any Man to ſpeak flightly or irreverently of ſo Holy a Principle. That Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Philoſopher and Emperor <hi>Antoninus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides divers other Paſſages to the purpoſe, hath expreſſed himſelf in one place in the very words before uſed by our Author. <hi>Seneca</hi> affirms it; <hi>Bonus Vir ſine Deo nemo est;</hi> beſides many Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to this purpoſe: And <hi>Cicero,</hi> beſides what more largely elſewhere, <hi>Nemo vir Magnus ſine aliquo Afflatu Divino unquam fuit. Socrates</hi> is notorious, and <hi>Plato,</hi> and his Followers <hi>Plotinus,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:192035:197"/>Porphirius, Jamblicus, Proclus,</hi> &amp;c. are known and confeſs'd to have been of the ſame Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as alſo the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. The ſame is obſerv'd of <hi>Democritus,</hi> That he thought that there were no Men Wiſe beſides thoſe who were inſpir'd with a Divine Influence: And <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> and indeed all the better Philoſophers, are noted to have had the ſame Sentiments. And even <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, as great a Rationaliſt as he was, hath plainly expreſſed himſelf to have been of the ſame Judgment, in ſeveral places. In one among the reſt to this effect: <hi>They who are moved by a Divine Inſtinct ought not to conſult Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but follow the Interior Inſtinct; becauſe they are moved by a better Principle than Humane Reaſon.</hi> And that the ſame Sentiments were among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in very ancient times, we may obſerve in the Sacred Scriptures, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.8. and 5.11. and long before, <hi>Job</hi> 32.8: 33.14, 15, 16. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.38. and 39.3. and before, 26.28. and before that, 21, 22. And for the <hi>Jews,</hi> it is very plain that in thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Books of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> this Divine Influence and Conduct is intended.</p>
                  <p>And for the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the Doctrine of our Saviour and his Apoſtles is ſo expreſs to this purpoſe, that they who would evade the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Senſe of their Words, are forced to ſtrain
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:192035:197"/>their Wits to the utmoſt, and their Conſciences too, I doubt, if they be not ſtupified before hand. I need not recite the places, which every one may have recourſe to at pleaſure; and therefore it may be ſufficient to note them under ſeveral Heads; as,

                  <p>More might be added, but theſe are more than enough. And to theſe it would not be hard to add a <hi>true Catholick Interpretation and Comment,</hi> that is, The Sentiments of <hi>the most ancient Chriſtian Writers,</hi> and others of the moſt Eminent of after Ages; ſuch as <hi>Hermas, Juſtine, Tatian, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Cyprian, Novatian, Hilary, Nazianzen, Ambroſe, Hierom, Auſtin,</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:192035:198"/>and many others; but it would be too long for this place and occaſion. And therefore to make ſhort Work, inſtead of that, I will here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their Sentiments in ſome ſhort Notes of an Eminent and moſt Learned Annotator, who was well acquainted with them, and doth ſometimes interſperſe ſome of their Teſtimonies in his Writings: It is the Famous <hi>Hugo Grotius. Theſe,</hi> ſaith he, upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. (who dedicate themſelves to God with a true Faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon are accounted his peculiar People) <hi>God, as he doth favour them with a peculiar Providence, ſo he ſeems to give to each an Angel Guardian to guide and aſſiſt them, either perpetually or certainly, until they come to</hi> the full Poſſeſſion of the Divine Spirit: <hi>For ſo I ſee the Ancient Chriſtians did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> And in his Pref. to his Annot. upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans. Into the Heart purified by Faith, as into a clean Veſſel, God doth infuſe his Spirit; I mean the Spirit of Christ full of Love of God, and of our Neighbour, and of all Goodneſs.—Thoſe who have this Spirit of God, and carefully keep it, God doth account as born of Him, and like unto Him; to them he gives a certain Right to Heavenly and Eternal Good Things.— Neither is the Heart purified but by Faith in Christ; nor is the Spirit infuſed but into a Heart ſo purified; nor doth he plainly own for his any but who are endowed with that Spirit.</hi> Upon <hi>Luke</hi> 22.3. <hi>As they who religiouſly obey
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:192035:199"/>the Divine Admonitions, at length receive the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling Spirit; ſo they who readily conſent to the Suggeſtions of the Devil, at length, God deſerting them, become the Slaves of Satan.</hi> Upon <hi>Jo.</hi> 5.45. <hi>Thoſe (to whom the Goſpel is Preached) become taught of God,</hi> that is, <hi>if they would, if they be greedy of it, if they do not reject the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits offered, and even forc'd upon them. They will have no need to have recourſe to Learned Men, that from them they may learn the Myſteries of the Old Teſtament.</hi> Upon <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God which is given to Believers, doth, among other things, imprint alſo Wiſdom in their Souls, not that of the things of this World, of which Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers did boaſt, but of thoſe things which conduce to a better Life. The ſame Spirit doth reveal alſo to thoſe who are his, things future and ſecret, which cannot be known by humane Means.</hi> Upon 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.20. <hi>The Spirit doth ſuggeſt to us in all Circumſtances, both the Precepts of Chriſt, and ſuch Hints or Notices as are meet for the Occaſion.</hi> v. 27. <hi>What we are to do in every Circumſtance: For there are certain Differences, which Times, Places, and Perſons, require. Therefore is there often need of Admonition to hit the way of our Duty.</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. Jo. 6.45. and, if you pleaſe, <hi>Seneca Epiſt.</hi> 94. And upon 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.9. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt teacheth you concerning all things to be done. By how much the more there is of the Spirit, ſo much the leſs need is there of Preſcripts.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:192035:199"/>This Place is not to be underſtood of the General Precept, but of ſpecial Determinations, as all Things, Perſons, and Times do require.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Thoſe who are led by the Spirit, as now of Age, have no need of the Law, the Guardian of their Youth.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Thoſe who walk after the Spirit,</hi> he interprets, <hi>thoſe who having obtained the Holy Spirit, do conſtantly obey its Motions:</hi> and afterwards, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>They that are after the Spirit,</hi> he interprets, <hi>thoſe who are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the Spirit of God; which doth not now come to paſs, but by Chriſt.</hi> And, <hi>v.</hi> 12. he notes, <hi>God hath given his Spirit that we ſhould uſe it;</hi> and again, <hi>So great a Gueſt will be treated with Care; otherwiſe he will bid farewell to his Lodging.</hi> And to conclude, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Spirit here,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is that Holy Spirit, inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Souls of Chriſtians, and if it be carefully kept, adhering to Souls unto Death, and after Death even to the Reſurrection;</hi> and then referrs to what he had ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. to <hi>Hierom</hi> upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. and recites, to the ſame purpoſe, the Words of <hi>Philo, Irenaeus, Tatianus, Clem. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian.</hi> More might be added; but this is enough to ſhew the Mind of this great Man, concerning the Neceſſity of our having the Spirit of God dwelling in us, the Effects of his Reſidence in Light and Conduct, and our Duty how to treat it.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:192035:201"/>That Glory is begun in Grace, and God is pleaſed to give ſome excellent Souls the happy Antepast: That holy Men in ancient times have ſought and gloried in this Enjoyment, and never complain ſo ſorely, as when it was with-held and interrupted: That the Expreſſions of Scripture run infinitely this way, and the beſt of modern good Men do, from their own Experience, atteſt it: That this ſpiritualizeth Religion, and renders its Enjoyments more comfortable and delicious: That it keeps the Soul under a vivid ſenſe of God, and is a grand Security againſt Temptation: That it holds it ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy amidſt the Flatteries of a proſperous State, and gives it the most grounded Anchorage and Support amidſt the Waves of an adverſe Condition: That 'tis the noblest Encouragement to Vertue, and the highest Aſſurance of an happy Immortality. I ſay, I</hi> conſidered <hi>theſe weighty Things, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at the Careleſsneſs and Prejudice of Thoughts, that occaſion'd my ſuſpecting the Reality of ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Priviledge: I ſaw how little Reaſon there is in denying Matters of inward Senſe, becauſe our ſelves do not feel them, or cannot form an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of them in our Minds: I am convinc'd that things of gust and reliſh must be judged by the ſentient and vital Faculties, and not by the noetical Exerciſes of ſpeculative <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings: And upon the whole, I</hi> believe <hi>infinitely, that the Divine Spirit affords its ſenſible Preſence, and immediate Beatifick Touch to ſome</hi> Rare Souls,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:192035:202"/>
                     <hi>who are diveſted of carnal Self, and mundane Pleaſures, abſtracted from the Body by Prayer and Holy Meditation; ſpiritual in their Deſires, and calm in their Affections; devout Lovers of God and Vertue, and tenderly affectionate to all the World; ſincere in their Aims, and circumſpect in their Actions; inlarged in their Souls, and clear in their Minds. Theſe, I think, are the</hi> Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions <hi>that are</hi> requiſite <hi>to fit us for</hi> Divine Communion: <hi>And God tranſacts not in this near way, but with prepared Spirits, who are thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the Manifeſtation of his Preſence, and his Influence; and ſuch, I believe, he never fails to bleſs with theſe happy fore taſts of Glory. But for thoſe that are Paſſionate and Conceited, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and Notional, Confident and Immodest, Imperious and Malicious; that doat upon Trifles, and run fiercely into the ways of a Sect; that are lifted up in the Apprehenſion of the glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of themſelves and their Party, and ſcorn all the World beſides; for ſuch, I ſay, be their Pretenſions what they will, to Divine Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Illapſes, and Diſcoveries, I believe them not; their Fancies abuſe them, or they would us: For what Communion hath Light with Darkneſs, or the Spirit of the Holy One with thoſe, whoſe Genius and Ways are ſo unlike Him? But the other</hi> Excellent Souls <hi>I deſcribed, will as certainly be viſited by the Divine Preſence and Converſe, as the Chryſtalline Streams are with the Beams of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:192035:202"/>Light, or the fitly prepared Earth, whoſe Seed is in it ſelf, will be actuated by the Spirit of Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is <hi>a late Writer</hi> of no mean Learning and Parts, and Authority too among thoſe of his own Party, who reckons the <hi>Deſpiſing of the Holy Spirit, and his Operations</hi> now, to be a Sin of the ſame Nature with the Apoſtacy of the <hi>Jews</hi> by Idolatry of old, and afterwards by rejecting of our Saviour at his coming: and yet in deteſtation of Enthuſiaſm, <hi>utterly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> all Impulſes and Motions <hi>to Things and Actions, which are not acknowledged Duties in themſelves, evidenced by the Word of Truth,</hi> &amp;c. under the Name of <hi>Irrational Impreſſions,</hi> and <hi>violent Inclinations:</hi> and what ſome Men intend by <hi>Impulſes,</hi> he ſays, he knows not. Indeed they who reject all ſuch things, reject they know not what. And did they thereby only hurt themſelves, it might be thought a juſt Puniſhment: but ſuch confident Aſſertions in Print may not only be hurtful to Men, but alſo injurious to the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, which is not to be limited by Mens Conceits. The <hi>Jews</hi> heretofore had the Favour <hi>to inquire of God,</hi> and receive <hi>Anſwers</hi> and <hi>Direction</hi> in their ſpecial Exigences: and if the Chriſtians are not allowed that Favour now, it may be thought that the State of Chriſtians is inferior to that of the Jews then, in a Matter of great
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:192035:203"/>Importance; or that the Chriſtians now are, as the latter Jews were, fallen from the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of the true Chriſtian State: Nor can I conceive any reaſon why Chriſtians ſhould not have ſome ſuch Means for this purpoſe, as the ancient Jews had, but that every Chriſtian ought to have a Divine Oracle in his own Breaſt, by the Reſidence of the Spirit of God there, if we were indeed ſuch as our Profeſſion doth require, and oblige us to be, that is, truly Spiritual, and Heavenly-minded. It doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concern us to inquire, whether the Fault be not in our ſelves, if God doth not anſwer us, as it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> when God was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him, rather than to diſhonour our Profeſſion, by arguing againſt the Truth to cover our Shame? and ſince the Lord's Ear is not heavy that it cannot hear, whether our Sins have not interpoſed between our God and us, that he will not hear? Certainly we often need a Wiſdom more than Humane in many Caſes, wherein the General Preſcripts are not ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>For, as many things are <hi>lawful,</hi> which may not be <hi>expedient;</hi> ſo many things may be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,</hi> or <hi>neceſſary,</hi> which may not be <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Duties in themſelves, evidenced by the Word of Truth,</hi> the written Word; and to the ſucceſsful Performance of acknowledged Duties certain <hi>Circumſtances</hi> may be, and often are ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:192035:203"/>neceſſary, that unleſs duly obſerved, all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours would be fruſtrate: and all theſe Expediences and Circumſtances may be, and frequently are, ſuch as are not diſcernable by us Mortals, without ſome <hi>Notice</hi> from more Intelligent Beings. If therefore the All-ſeeing, Wiſe, and Gracious God, be pleaſed, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by his own Spirit, or mediately by any of the Inviſible Miniſters of his Providence, to afford any ſuch Divine Favours to ſuch Mortals as are duly diſpoſed for the ſame; if taking notice of the Sincerity of his Servant, he be pleaſed, by any ſecret <hi>Impreſſion</hi> upon his Heart or Mind, or other Notices, to conduct him in theſe things, or in any thing of his Will and Pleaſure, though without manifeſting the Reaſons of it, to exerciſe his Reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Subjection of his Intellect to the Divine Wiſdom, as well as his Will to Obedience to his Pleaſure: as he who after competent Experience of this, ſhould be diſobedient to any ſuch Notice, would certainly incurr <hi>Sin</hi> more or leſs, and juſtly deſerve Correction; ſo it would be no leſs <hi>Impiety</hi> againſt that Holy Majeſty, and Miſchief to Men, to raiſe amongſt them any Scandal or Prejudice againſt it, and thereupon a great Indiſpoſition for it, by any <hi>undue Oppoſition of Fanaticiſm,</hi> without ſufficient Diſtinction and Caution, than it is <hi>Impudence</hi> and Inconſiderateneſs in others, to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:192035:204"/>and their Followers to the Deluſions of Evil Spirits by high Pretences to ſuch Divine and extraordinary Favours, without any Regard to, or Notice of thoſe ſpecial Qualifications, and Cautions for Tryal of Spirits, which are neceſſary to capacitate them for ſuch Favour, and to ſecure them againſt ſuch Deluſions. It requires therefore no ſmall <hi>Caution,</hi> (to uſe this Author's Expreſſion) that under an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious Name they reject not ſuch Favours, or calumniate ſuch an Holy Conduct: and, that they eſpecially who reproach others with limiting the Holy Spirit, do not themſelves in this, what in other things they condemn in others, with leſs Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>And certainly great Caution is likewiſe to be uſed <hi>on the other ſide,</hi> that we preſume not to attribute to the Holy Spirit of God, what is meerly the Imaginations or Effuſions of our own Spirit; what is meerly Humane Invention, or Artifice; and even the Inſpirations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of Satan transformed into an Angel of Light. By this means is great Indignity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly done to the Holy and Pure Spirit: and great Sin contracted by Mens arrogating to themſelves thoſe Gifts and Graces, which they have little of, and recommending themſelves and their Performances upon ſuch high Pretences; and great Scandal given to People to think meanly of ſo great a Principle of our Religion.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:192035:204"/>
                  <p> There are <hi>three Great-Means</hi> which God hath provided for us to lead us into all neceſſary Truth: <hi>Natural Reaſon, Supernatural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> communicated by Perſons authorized by Divine Commiſſion ſo to do, and <hi>Special Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Direction</hi> of the Holy Spirit. And they who carefully uſe all theſe in their due Order, cannot err. But they who ſet up theſe one againſt another, do uſually run themſelves and lead others into great Errors. And hence it is that ſo great Diſorders and Miſchiefs have through the Subtilty and Energy of Satan been brought into the Church by Perſons pretending to ſome one of theſe in a kind of Oppoſition to ſome other of them: either of Right Reaſon, or of the Pure Word of God; or of the Spirit and Spiritual Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>I do not doubt but they who pretend moſt to <hi>Right Reaſon,</hi> in oppoſition to Inſpiration, are even therein very ſtrongly inſpired, but by the ſubtile Spirit of Oppoſition, and are in effect as great and pernicious Fanaticks as any, though they leaſt ſuſpect it. But not only thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Atheiſtical Pretenders</hi> to Reaſon, who deſpiſe all Revelation and Revealed Religion; but ſuch as profeſs themſelves Chriſtians; and not only that <hi>inſolent and preſumptuous Sect,</hi> who aſſert the Divine Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and yet make no ſcruple to ſtrain and wreſt them to comply with their pre-conceived
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:192035:205"/>Notions; but more <hi>Moderate Men,</hi> and ſuch as pretend higheſt to the Pure Word of God, and to the moſt pure Spiritual Worſhip, and cry out againſt Man-made Divinity, and againſt Fanaticiſm too; by indulging too much to their own Conceits, have brought ſuch <hi>Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Miſchiefs</hi> into the Church, as are not much to be doubted were the Fruits of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and Impreſſions of the Spirit of Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon their Mind. Hence are many run from Superſtition into Prophaneneſs; from Idolatry into Sacrilege; from Formality into Contempt or Neglect of the moſt Solemn Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Worſhip; from beggarly Rudiments and Carnal Ordinances, to make light of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Chriſt; from Monkiſh Auſterity, as they call it, into common Indulgence and Gratifications to Senſe; from Popiſh Merit into Carleſſneſs, Worldly-mindedneſs, Selfiſhneſs, and little Concern for the Honour of God, or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Souls; from the Traditions of Men and Popiſh Pretences, to deny all, even of the Apoſtles, the Authority of the Catholick Church, and the Catholick Senſe and Interpretation of divers of the Evangelical and Apoſtolical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Directions; and, at laſt, to limit our Saviour's Sermon upon the Mount to the times of Perſecution, till, at laſt, by thoſe means, we are grown ripe for a Perſecution, or ſome other ſevere awakening and purging Judgment. All
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:192035:205"/>this, and more that might be noted, we cannot impute meerly to the Weakneſs and Corruption of Men, unleſs we can imagin that all the Powers of Darkneſs have been all the while meer idle Spectators. But if they have been ſo ſubtle and active thus to deceive the Gentiles in theſe latter times, and the beſt of Men have not been exempt from their Aſſaults, it concerns all to beware that they be not deceived by a Spirit of Deluſion under any of theſe Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, either of the Good Spirit, or of the Scripture, or of Reaſon: that they embrace not falſe Concluſions inſtead of Right Reaſon, their own Conceits, or the Novel Opinions of ſome Sect, inſtead of the Genuine Senſe of the Scriptures, or Satan transformed for the Spirit of God; <hi>leaſt, by any means, as the Serpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled</hi> Eve <hi>through his Subtilty, their Minds ſhould be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there is no way poſſible to eſcape this but by the Aid, Illumination, and Conduct of the Holy Spirit of God. Nor are any to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be led by that Spirit, when they go out of the way preſcribed by Chriſt, and by his Apoſtles, who were Commiſſioned by Him: for it is the Spirit of Chriſt, and <hi>of his Fulneſs we all receive.</hi> As the Law was our School-maſter to bring us unto Chriſt, ſo is Obſervance of the Preſcripts of the Goſpel deſigned for our Tutourage, to bring us to the Spirit. To that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:192035:206"/>we muſt come, or we are none of his: but that way we muſt come, and in that way we muſt keep, or elſe we ſhall be led by the Spirit of Error, and miſtake that for the Spirit of Truth. If we do well conſider the Holy Scriptures, the Nature of the Holy Spirit, and the Fruits of the Spirit, we may learn what <hi>Qualifications</hi> are requiſite to obtain that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Treaſure; and by what <hi>Signs and Characters</hi> it may be known and diſtinguiſhed. And thereby we may diſcern that many, who pretend highly to the Spirit, are much out of the way of the true Spirit of God; and many led by the ſubtile Spirit of Antichriſt, under the appearance of an Angel of Light, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Goſpel and Inſtitutions of Chriſt; to do deſpite to the Spirit of Grace, and to raiſe Scandals and Prejudices againſt the Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which they pretend, and it may be think to aſſert, and to indiſpoſe Men for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of thoſe Graces, which thoſe envious and malicious Spirits may know to be ready to be communicated to them. And this ſhould make others the more cautious, that they be not ſubſervient to, and be made the very Tools of theſe wicked Agents in their Oppoſition, leaſt at laſt they be involved with them in their Condemnation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>True way to reduce the miſled People,</hi> is, not to deny or diſſemble the Holy Doctrine,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:192035:206"/>much leſs to villifie or reproach it; but plainly to aſſert the Truth, and ſhew them wherein, and by what Means they are miſled from it: 1. That <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> is the moſt precious and deſirable thing in the World, and abſolutely neceſſary; but it is to be <hi>deſired</hi> principally to transform us into its own Nature; to lead us into all neceſſary Truth; to endue us with Power to overcome all our Corruptions, and all Temptations, and to adorn us with all thoſe Graces, which ennoble Humane Nature, and raiſe it above its ſelf, and ſo make us Chriſtians indeed; and to conduct us in all the important Occurrences of our Lives: but to deſire it for Matters of Oſtentation, to glory in Divine Communications, or over-earneſtly ſeek after the Conſolations, through impatience of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spiritual Croſs, are great Signs that ſuch Souls are either quite out of the way, or have made but little Progreſs. 2. That Satan is often transformed into an Angel of Light; and therefore we muſt be careful to try the Spirits. 3. That <hi>whatever is contrary to Sound Doctrine,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.10: 2.1. <hi>to the Doctrine, which is according to Godlineſs,</hi> ibid. 6.3. <hi>the Doctrine taught by the Apoſtles,</hi> Rom. 16.17. Gal. 1.8. <hi>to the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> Jud. 3. cannot be from the true Spirit, the Spirit of Chriſt. 4. That ſuch Spirits as lead into <hi>Diviſions, Separations,</hi> and <hi>Sects,</hi> lead
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:192035:207"/>out of the way of the True Spirit of God: and whatever lead into contempt or diſreſpect of the <hi>Sacred Scriptures,</hi> or any of the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> or <hi>Inſtitutions of Christ,</hi> are certainly Spirits of Antichriſt, how ſpecious ſoever their Pretences may be: for the Conſcientious and Reverend Uſe of theſe are the very Means whereby Souls are prepared for the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Spirit of God, and whereby it is ordinarily communicated to them. <hi>Cui Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas comperta ſine Deo? Cui Deus cognitus ſine Chriſto? Cui Chriſtus exploratus ſine Spiritu Sancto? Cui Spiritus Sanctus accommodatus ſine Fidei Sacramento?</hi> ſaith an ancient and eminent Chriſtian, <hi>Tertul. de Anima, c.</hi> 1. <q>To whom is Truth diſcovered without God? To whom is God known without Chriſt? To whom is Chriſt manifeſt without the Holy Spirit? To whom is the Holy Spirit granted without the Sacrament of Faith?</q> that is, <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> 5. And more particularly in reſpect to ſome amongſt us; That they who aſſert this Doctrine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Diſtinction</hi> or <hi>Caution,</hi> are not much to be regarded; and if they be Men of Learning, and may be preſumed not to be ignorant what Cautions and Rules are given by Learned and Experienced Chriſtians, to diſtinguiſh the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures of Evil Spirits from the Conduct or Motions of the Good, are much to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to ſerve another Intereſt then what
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:192035:207"/>they pretend to thoſe they miſlead; and that they all expoſe People to the Deluſions of Evil Spirits, which readily embrace ſuch Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. 6. That there were ſpecial Reaſons why God ordered <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſmite the Waters and the Duſt with the Rod, and to take hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of Aſhes from the Furnace and ſprinkle it towards the Heaven, and to erect the Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the Wilderneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to produce the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed effects; and why our Saviour made Clay with Spittle, and anointed the Eyes of the Blind Man, and then bad him waſh, and many other ſuch things, for which perhaps no Man did nor doth know the reaſon; and yet, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, if theſe Orders had not been obſerved, the Effect had not follow'd. 7. That it is but reaſonable that God ſhould give Orders, without declaring the Reaſon, for Tryal and Exerciſe of the Subjection of the Intellectual Faculties of his Creatures; and that in ſuch Caſe, if the Orders be not obſerved, it is not likely the Effect ſhould follow: and that if there were no more than this Exerciſe of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Submiſſion to the Wiſdom of God, in <hi>the Chriſtian Sacraments,</hi> it could not be imagined to be the Spirit of Chriſt, that ſhould lead Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to deſpiſe or neglect theſe <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi> of Chriſt: But in them there is more; for Inſtance, in that of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> it is the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, and external Act of Declaration of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:192035:208"/>our Engagement in <hi>Covenant</hi> with Chriſt: and the Refuſal of it is as much as to refuſe to Seal and Deliver a Bond; which whoever ſhould refuſe to do, and yet pretend to give Bond, might be looked upon as a Knave or a Cheat: and in that of <hi>the Holy Communion,</hi> there is a great and Solemn Duty of <hi>Recognition</hi> of the abſolute Dominion of the Father by Right of Creation, and of the Son by Right of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, over us and all we are and have; a Symbolical Oblation of our ſelves and of all we have to God, in a <hi>Commemorative Sacrifice</hi> and Repreſentation of the Paſſion of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father, as the Great Propitiation for the Sins of the World, of as full <hi>import</hi> to all intents and purpoſes to Chriſtians, as were all the Sacrifices of the Jews to them, which were but Types of the ſame; a Holy <hi>Rite of Addreſs</hi> to God the Father, by Chriſt the Mediator, through the Merit and Satisfaction of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which alone our Prayers and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings have acceptance with him; and of <hi>Spiritual Communion</hi> with God in Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Divine Power and Vertue is as really com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Souls duly diſpoſed, as Vertue went out of him and healed the People, and the Woman who touched the Hem of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And theſe have been the Sentiments, and this the moſt ſolemn and peculiar Worſhip of the Chriſtian Church, all over the World,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:192035:208"/>from the riſing of the Sun to the going down of the ſame, performed every day in moſt of the great Churches, and every Lord's-Day in all, from the times of the Apoſtles till the laſt Age. It is an Ordinance of ſo great Honour to our Saviour, and Benefit to Souls duly diſpos'd, that there can hardly be a greater Evidence of the Prevalence of the Spirit of Antichriſt, and of Satan transformed, than Diſreſpect and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of it, under pretence of a more ſpiritual Worſhip: For nothing can be more grievous to that envious and malicious Spirit, than to ſee that <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which he had moſt maliciouſly procured, to be ſo honoured all over the World, and applyed to his Confuſion; and therefore hath he oppos'd it with all the Subtilty and Malice he could poſſible. Beſides, for People to ſlight it under pretence of Chriſt being come to them in the Spirit, is a manifeſt and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous piece of Spiritual Pride ſo to ſet up themſelves above the Primitive Chriſtians, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who had ſo great a Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Spirit with them; and therefore another pregnant Evidence of the Spirit of Deluſion. And if we do well conſider what decays of Charity and Unanimity among Men, and of Piety and Devotion to God, hath in all parts attended the Neglect of this Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that may be another Evidence of what Spirit they are of, who do neglect it,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:192035:209"/>whatever their Pretences be. But for <hi>all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts and Sectaries</hi> in general, it is matter of great Caution that the Scriptures are ſo full of Admonitions and Prohibitions againſt <hi>Schiſms</hi> and <hi>Diviſions,</hi> and of Predictions, both by our Saviour himſelf, and by his Apoſtles, both of the Variety of them, and of the Danger, in that ſome of them have that ſpecious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, as to deceive, if it were poſſible, the very Elect. And if we look into the Hiſtory of the Church in former times, we ſhall find little or nothing of the true Spirit among any of any Party of Separatiſts, but much of the Spirit of Error or Deluſion. And therefore when we find a Manifeſtation of the Preſence or Energy of ſome Spirit, and a Concurrence of divers of theſe Indications or Signs, we may be aſſured and confident that it is an Antichriſtian Spirit, be its appearance never ſo ſpecious in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. And in theſe <hi>two things</hi> eſpecially, have ſuch as have been partakers of the true Spirit, found themſelves to be ſometimes ſtrangely <hi>aſſaulted and tempted</hi> by the ſubtile Adverſary, <hi>viz.</hi> to Spiritual Pride, and undervaluation of other Perſons, and to neglect of the Ordinances of Chriſt, as needleſs to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Way, whereby the ancient Religious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were generally preſerved</hi> from theſe and ſuch like Snares, was, that they were trained up, as the Sons of the Prophets of old, under ancient
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:192035:209"/>experienced Chriſtians in all kind of Exerciſes of Humility, Subjection both of Mind and Will, and conſtant diſcovery of the Diſpoſitions and Motions of their Hearts to their Superiors, and of all Grace and Vertue. But where both Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice hath been neglected, it is not ſtrange that amongſt many Appearances and Pretences there ſhould be found little of Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; eſpecially where thoſe noble Heroick Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Abſtraction,</hi> and <hi>Contempt of the World, Heavenly-mindedneſs,</hi> and <hi>continual Attendance to God,</hi> &amp;c. are rejected as <hi>Monkery</hi> and <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> but all their goodly Appearances and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences end, at laſt, in Emptineſs and Scandal. And therefore it concerns all, who have any Care of their Souls, to beware of all ſuch as are out of the Way and Method of the Ancients.</p>
                  <p>But, on the other ſide, to take ſuch Offence at the Miſcarriages of ſuch as have been led into Error by any ſeducing Spirit, as therefore to oppoſe the Conduct of the Spirit of Truth, or any of its Operations, and elude the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and undermine the Doctrine thereof, is as certainly the Effect of the Operation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Antichriſt, and, in truth, as much Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm as the other, in the contrary Extream. For the <hi>Good Spirit</hi> is as abſolutely neceſſary to be had, as all others to be avoided; for without it we canot be genuine living Chriſtians, but meer empty formal Profeſſors; of which ſort, it

                  <p>But leſt any well-minded Soul ſhould be troubled with any doubts in this reſpect, we muſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>Having</hi> the Spirit, and the <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of the Spirit; and between the <hi>Operations</hi> of the Spirit, the <hi>Gifts</hi> of the Spirit, and the <hi>Graces</hi> of the Spirit: and know, that as there may be the Operations of the Spirit, where there are not the Gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and the Gifts of the Spirit, where there are not the Graces of the Spirit: ſo, on the other ſide, there may be the <hi>Reſidence</hi> of the Spirit, where there is no ſenſible diſtinguiſhable <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of the Spirit. For the Operations and Communications of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are often ſo ſubtile and ſecret in the manner, both in Illumination, and Power, and Inclination of the Will, as are not manifeſt by Senſe, but by Faith only, and we know not how they are wrought in us. But as the moſt deſirable Graces of the Spirit are <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Effectual Sanctification,</hi> ſo the Fruits and Effects thereof are the moſt infallible Notes of the Preſence of the Good Spirit, which always leads to Mortification of all Carnal and Earthly Affections, and to the Perfection of all Coeleſtial, Angelick and Divine Diſpoſitions in the Soul. But to Souls duly prepared, purged and diſpoſed for it, that Bleſſed Guide doth often manifeſt his Preſence by Senſible Attractions and Reſtraints upon the Heart, and plain Suggeſtions to the Mind; and to ſuch as once find that, I can give no better Advice then what we have, <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 4.— and 6.— which, I believe, was part of the <hi>Myſtick Theology</hi> of the Ancients.</p>

And this being ſo, What Entertainment is ſuch a Diſcourſe as this like to meet with in the World?

                  <p>ALmighty <hi>God</hi> doth in many things <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi> the greater Collective Bodies of <hi>Men,</hi> as he doth the leſſer of Families, and ſingle Perſons: and therefore what is the <hi>Duty</hi> of ſingle Perſons, or of the Heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, under ſeveral occurrences of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, the very ſame is the <hi>Duty</hi> of the Governors of thoſe greater Bodies, whether they be Civil, or Eccleſiaſtical. And therefore again, as when any Croſs or Affliction befalls a Perſon, if he have any Senſe of God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:192035:213"/>in him, he ought not to neglect it, as an inſenſible Creature, or a brute Beaſt; nor to look upon it, as a meer Accident and Misfortune, like an Atheiſt or Infidel; but to acknowledge the Hand and Providence of God in it, examin himſelf, and conſider well for what intent or purpoſe, it may have been ordered or permitted by the Righteous, Wiſe, and Gracious Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence of God, and without delay apply himſelf to do and perform what that Diſpenſation doth appear to him to call for.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Diviſions, Schiſms, and Separations</hi> of Parties do fall out in a Church, theſe are ſuch Afflictions, as ought to be looked upon, as the Loſs of one in a Family, or of a Member in a particular Perſon; and therefore not to be made light of, or paſſed over as Misfortunes and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, but to be well conſidered, as ordered or permitted by the Special Providence of God, with great Juſtice and Wiſdom, and therefore for ſome ſpecial End to be inquired into, taken notice of, and obſerved by his Church, that they may thereupon apply themſelves to what he requireth of them for his Service and their own Good. When this is neglected, all other Means uſually prove not only ineffectual, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of more or greater Evils.</p>
                  <p>What was written afore-time, was written for our Admonition and Inſtruction: and as we are plainly told, that in the Diviſion and Separation
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:192035:213"/>of the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> from the Houſe of <hi>David, the Cauſe was from the Lord,</hi> 1 Ki. 12.15. So in that great <hi>Diviſion of the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches,</hi> and breach of Communion between them; and in the Weſtern Church that great Diviſion and <hi>Separation of all thoſe Churches, call'd Reform'd;</hi> and in the great Diviſion again amongſt them into <hi>Lutheran and Calvanist,</hi> and the ſeveral <hi>Sub-diviſions</hi> of ſeveral Parties and Sects amongſt them; and laſtly, to come nearer home, in all the Diviſions, Sub-diviſions, Sects and Parties, which have ſeparated from <hi>the Church of England,</hi> and afterward one from another, there is as certainly the Hand of God, and did we conſider it well, we might plainly ſee that the Cauſe is from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>This we can all ſee in the Great Diviſion, and Separation of all theſe Churches call'd <hi>Reformed,</hi> from that of <hi>Rome;</hi> but ſhe her ſelf either can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not or will not ſee it: And this, to ſay no more of the Foreigners here, our Diſſenters at home think they ſee, and do ſee; but we of the <hi>Church of England</hi> do not ſee, or will not ſee, to any purpoſe as we ought. But as they of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> lay all upon the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and will acknowledge nothing amiſs among themſelves; ſo we of the <hi>Church of England</hi> lay all upon the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> and <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> but will acknowledge nothing amiſs among our ſelves. And that which dazzles the Eyes, and blinds the Minds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:192035:214"/>in both, is chiefly the Pomps and Vanities of the World (which are renounced at <hi>Baptiſm</hi>) without, and the God of this World, who blinds their Minds, within. The things of this World, to Earthly-minded People, are like Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-Plumbs to Children, which ſtop their Mouths, and ſatisfie them that all is well with them.</p>
                  <p>But if things were more narrowly looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it might be perceived, That there is ſcarce any Party of Separatiſts or Diſſenters, that hath not ſomething of <hi>Truth peculiar</hi> to them; and that there is ſomething in particular <hi>amiſs</hi> in the Church, which gave <hi>Occaſion</hi> to that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and whereof ſomething peculiar in that Sect may ſerve for Admonition. And therefore, that in all there is a ſecret <hi>Providence of God,</hi> ordering or permitting them for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Correction, Reproof, and Admonition to reform, unto the Church, and unto thoſe very Parties, in which any ſuch Diviſion and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been made. But generally all they, who ſhould have taken the Admonition, have had their Mouths ſo ſtopp'd, and been ſo bribed and enchanted with the Devil's Sugar-Plumbs and Baits of Preferments, that while all was ſo well with them, as they thought, they could ſee nothing amiſs in the Church, but magnified it, as a moſt glorious Church, and layed all the Fault upon the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> and <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:192035:214"/>they thought only wanted what they were poſſeſſed of; and the Scandal of their Ambition, Pride and Covetouſneſs, and Neglect of a due Care of Souls, hath, by their Preaching, I doubt, betrayed more Souls into the Snares of the Devil, than all their Preaching hath reſcued out of them, and throughly converted unto God. It is <hi>a ſad Truth,</hi> but Truth it is, and a Great one too, and very manifeſt to all, whoſe Eyes are open, That our <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> and Church <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,</hi> which were deſigned by our Pious Anceſtors, for the promotion of true Piety, as well as Learning, are, by the Subtilty of Satan, and Neglect of true Piety and Devotion to God, become very ſubſervient to the Kingdom of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, leſs to the Kingdom of Light; From which corrupt <hi>Fountain</hi> hath proceeded, one way or other, not only all our <hi>Diviſions,</hi> but moſt of all the <hi>Evils,</hi> which do now afflict either the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical or Civil State: and if ſome very good Care be not ſpeedily taken, more and greater yet are more like to enſue, than theſe be removed.</p>
                  <p>Of all the Sects which have ſprung up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, there is none more conſiderable in this reſpect, whereof I am ſpeaking, or leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as it ought to be, than that of the QUAKERS, as they are abuſively called; begun by <hi>GEORGE FOX,</hi> a young Man, born of mean, but honeſt and religious Parents, at <hi>Drayton</hi> in <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> in the Year
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:192035:215"/>of our Lord 1624. and educated from his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der years in the Fear of the Lord, but to no more Humane Learning than only to read <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> and write indifferently. He was in his Youth diſpoſed to Virtue and Piety; and when upward of Nineteen <hi>retired</hi> from his Relations and Acquaintance, and <hi>lived</hi> in divers places, <hi>where he was not known,</hi> working at his Trade of a <hi>Shoe-maker,</hi> with his hands for his Livelyhood, but exerciſing his Mind in ſerious Meditations, both while at his Work, and at other times of Leiſure eſpecially. In the Year 1646. he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, That <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity Learning</hi> was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to qualifie Men to be Miniſters of Chriſt; and thereupon, inſtead of hearing them, uſed to <hi>retire</hi> with his Bible <hi>into Solitary places,</hi> joyning neither with the Miniſters of the Church, nor with the Diſſenters, but relying wholly upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for his Inward Teaching. At another time he underſtood, That God, who made the World, did not dwell in Temples made with Hands, but in his Peoples Hearts. And in the Year 1647. having been for ſome time exerciſed with Temptations and Troubles in his Mind, he came farther to underſtand, <hi>That all was done, and to be done, in and by Christ;</hi> and, <hi>How he conquers and deſtroys the Tempter.</hi> And ſome time after he went among the Profeſſors at <hi>Duckenfield, &amp; Mancheſter,</hi> and <hi>declared Truth</hi> (as he calls it) amongſt them, and alſo at <hi>Broughton</hi> in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:192035:215"/>
                     <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Mansfield</hi> in <hi>Northampton-ſhire;</hi> and then People came far and near to ſee him. And here his Preaching ſeems to have commenced. And in 1648. were divers Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Friends in ſeveral Places. And this was the Beginning of that Sect, which is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo conſiderable in outward Appearance, and I wiſh more conſiderable in a true inward Power than it is. For as all Man-kind are apt to relapſe and ſink down again from the Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which God at any time raiſed them: ſo I doubt are this People now relapſed very much into a Form, only of a different ſort and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
                  <p>The Beginning of <hi>George Fox</hi> ſeems to have been by and under a true Divine Conduct; ſuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> was led by; ſuch as <hi>Moſes</hi> was driven by from the Court of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> into the Wilderneſs; and ſuch as the Holy Prophets of Old, and greater numbers of Holy Chriſtians afterwards, were partly led, and partly driven by into the Wilderneſs, Solitary places, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement from Relations, Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; as our Saviour ſaith, to forſake Father and Mother, Brother and Siſter, and Houſe and Land, for his ſake: and in thoſe Retirements he did receive <hi>Openings,</hi> as he calls it, of Truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: and when he came from his Retirement, and went into the Meetings of Profeſſors, he did <hi>declare Truth</hi> indeed, as he expreſſeth it. For
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:192035:216"/>it is a certain Truth, that Univerſity Learning, that Preaching and Praying at Churches, or elſewhere, that the Studying of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the Profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, the Uſe of the Sacraments, and moſt frequent and conſtant uſe of the great and chief Solemnity of the Chriſtian Worſhip; nay, even Zeal for Chriſt, and doing Miracles in his Name, and Reliance upon his Merits, are all, though good in their kind, and very neceſſary, and ſome ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary; yet are all ſhort and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to thoſe, who reſt in them, and ſeek not in all and above all, that inward Principle of Light and Life, which is Chriſt in them, who receive him in Sincerity and Purity, and retain it by faithful and ready Obedience to his Conduct.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>George</hi> ſaw very well and rightly. And if he did, in the heat of Diſputes, either through Tranſport, or any humane Infirmity, or through the Subtilty of Satan getting any Advantage of him, over-ſhoot himſelf, it is no more than what <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the reſt of the Reformers, have done; who, whether they have reformed or deformed moſt, may very well bear a Diſpute; and he and his Party deſerve to be pitied, and helped out by gentle and kind means. And great <hi>reaſon</hi> there is <hi>for it,</hi> upon two accounts at the leaſt. 1. Becauſe the Scandals given were the occaſions of their Errors. 2. Becauſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity having before been pull'd to pieces, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:192035:216"/>no where compleat, intire, and clear from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and Abuſes to be found in any Church or Party of People in the World, they of all the parts choſe the better, the Soul, leaving the Body, as a dead Carcaſs to the reſt.</p>
                  <p>It is true, this is in a great Meaſure to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to thoſe, who by their Empty Formality gave the Occaſion; yet it was a Fault in Them, who took ſuch Offence at it. What God hath joyned together, Man muſt not preſume to put aſunder: If the <hi>Leaper</hi> be commanded to waſh in <hi>Jordan,</hi> (2 King. 5.10.) he muſt not think that to waſh in the Rivers of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> will do as well: If the <hi>Blind Man</hi> be commanded to waſh in <hi>Siloam,</hi> (Jo. 9.7.) or even <hi>Moſes</hi> to caſt up Aſhes into the Air, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 9.8.) the Command muſt be obeyed and obſerved, or the Effect ſhall not follow: If People be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Baptized in the Name of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> that their Sins may be forgiven, and that they may receive the Holy Ghoſt, (<hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 41.) if they preſume to neglect and cavil at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, their Sins are more like to be increaſed and faſter bound, than forgiven, and they more like to receive Satan transformed in a Spirit of Deluſion, than the Holy Spirit of God; and to die in their Sins, though with many falſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, than to come to true Reſt in the Lord, in any other way than he hath preſcribed. God's Command, if it be but the forbearing of an A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:192035:217"/>(<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17: 3.3, 6, 11.) or the doing that, which our Reaſon cannot underſtand, muſt be obſerved punctually. Diſobedience to the Wiſdom of God, is no leſs a Sin than Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to his Will. And therefore I dare not excuſe this People in this; for their Sin may be greater, and their Caſe more dangerous, than they or I can imagin: but I cannot but pity them, be ready to help them, to hope the beſt, becauſe they were led into it, and did it through Ignorance, Prejudice, and the Scandals of others; and to ſpeak comfortably to all that will receive it, and ſubmit to <hi>the Call of God,</hi> humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before Him, and return to their Duty. But the Sin of thoſe, who ſhall refuſe, and go on obſtinately, will be greatly aggravated, and their Caſe more dangerous and difficult. If they fall into the Ditch, the company of a blind Guide will not ſave them: If they die in their Sins, it will be but a ſorry Comfort to them that their Blood muſt be required of another.</p>
                  <p>But to help them out, I know no better and more effectual way, than to detect the Snare and Stratagem whereby they fell, and the Stone at which they ſtumbled. And it was no other than what I have mentioned already in general, the <hi>Scandal</hi> given by others, and <hi>Offence</hi> taken by them: but it will be neceſſary to conſider it more particularly: and the firſt particular, that I obſerve in the Journal of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> was an empty
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:192035:217"/>
                     <hi>Formality void of the Power</hi> of Godlineſs, that he perceived and felt in all Parties, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors as well as the Prieſts, as he calls them: that they were Miniſters not of the Spirit, but of the Letter only, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. that their Preaching was but with Wiſdom of Words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. with the inticing Words of Man's Wiſdom, <hi>ibid.</hi> 2.4. or at beſt but a Miniſtration of the Letter, not of the Spirit. (I do not write his Words, but his Senſe.) And this was an undeniable Evidence, and Demonſtration of the inſufficiency of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity Learning</hi> alone (alone I ſay) to qualifie Men to be Miniſters of Chriſt; for there were of both ſorts, thoſe who wanted not that, if that had been ſufficient: And if we inquire into the true reaſon of that, how that comes to paſs, ſince a principal End of our Univerſities is to qualifie Perſons for that Service, we ſhall preſently diſcover that, which is the Root, and true Cauſe, both of that, and of almoſt all the Unhappineſs of this Nation; and that is a great Defect, and <hi>Neglect of Teaching and Learning the best and chief part of all Learning and Knowledge;</hi> of true Heavenly Wiſdom. Their Learning is plainly ſuch an ineffectual Learning, which doth deceive their Souls, being void of the chief ſolid Food, like Chaff without the Corn, and Husks without the Kernel: it ſtops the Mouth, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Stomach; but famiſheth the Soul: and not only ſo, but, like unwholſome Food, breeds
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:192035:218"/>only Wind &amp; Crudities, a Knowledge that puſſeth up, and Diſeaſes; a ſuperficial Notional Buſineſs, without any thing of true Culture and Food of Souls: a Form plainly without the Power; ſuch a Cheat and Deceit, as the moſt virulent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of any call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> could not exceed; but even Indignation would extort almoſt as much from a ſober Man duly ſenſible of it. It deceives themſelves; it deceives the People, whom they undertake to feed; and it deceives the whole Nation.</p>
                  <p>The Teaching here is agreeable to <hi>the Deſign of thoſe who come to learn;</hi> a mixt Deſign of an unnatural Compoſure, Heaven and Earth, or rather Earth and Heaven; not ſo much God and Mammon, (which, according to our Saviour's Doctrine, are inconſiſtent) but Mammon and God; for the principal in the Deſign in this Caſe ought firſt to be named: and it is viſible in their Actions which that is; and even in their Common Expreſſions: for if one propoſe a Place with all the Advantages of doing Good that may be, preſently comes this filthy fulſome Queſtion; <hi>But what Encouragement is there?</hi> as if an Advantage for doing Good was not En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement enough to a Chriſtian to enter into the Service of God, without ſome humane aſſurance of I know not what temporal Income. And Preferments are not only thought, but plainly aſſerted to be the <hi>Encouragements of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:192035:218"/>and I doubt they have their Reward. What <hi>unſatiable Greedineſs</hi> is obſervable gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in all, to be ſcandalous in almoſt the beſt, that can come at them! And what is the Uſe they make of them, when they have with great Study, and Pains, and Solicitations, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances, and Flatteries, and Coſts, at laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them; but Pride, and Luxury, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies of Wives, and Children; to which all<note n="*" place="bottom">v. <hi>Fa. Paul, Of Matters Beneficiary,</hi> N. <hi>236,237. &amp; f.</hi> a Sin to miſpend that which exceeds the moderate Neceſſity of a Clergy-Man.</note> That muſt be ſacrificed, which was deſigned for Proviſion for true Food of Souls; of which Thouſands are daily famiſhed, for want of a competent number of duly qualified Labourers in the Lord's Vineyard, in the great Pariſhes about this City, and other parts of the Nation, where there is Maintenance enough, if ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were imployed, as did indeed make that their Buſineſs, Care and Concern. All their Learning raiſeth but few above the Senſual, to the Animal State; but none to the truly Spiritual: if any attain to that, it is by ſuch Means as may be uſed any where elſe, as well as at the Univerſity, as things are there ordered at preſent; and not by Univerſity Learning, which, as it is ordinarily uſed, doth more hinder than further it. Nor is it likely it ſhould have much better Effect upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which hath no better upon themſelves: For in the Spiritual Generation, as in the Carnal, Men beget their like; the ſtrong, ſuch as are ſtrong; and the weak and infirm, ſuch as themſelves are.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:192035:219"/>
                  <p> But if we look farther into <hi>the Concerns of the whole Nation,</hi> and their Duty to their Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in that reſpect, are not they to be both ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally and jointly, not only Paſtors, but Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; ſeverally over their own particular Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and jointly over the whole Nation? But what an inſignificant Generation are they, even the Chief of them in that reſpect, not only far ſhort of the Generoſity and Magnanimity of genuine Chriſtians, and the more immediate Servants of the Great Jehovah, but even of the natural Genius of their own Nation; as if their <hi>Preferments</hi> had ſome Narcotick and ſtupifying quality, or ſome ſecret Enchantment in them: And ſo in truth they have; they are like the <hi>Trojan Horſe;</hi> when they think they have got a great Prize, they themſelves are ſurprized and captivated by, they little think what, inviſible Enemies. When they return to the Pomps and Vanities of the World, which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in their Baptiſm, they deſert the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Chriſtian State, and enter into the Power of the Enemy; and their true Chriſtian Strength departs from them: they have no longer any real ſtrength to ſerve the Lord Chriſt, but only ſuch an Appearance of it, as ſerves to deceive themſelves and others; and make them the more effectually ſubſervient to that Intereſt, which they do not deſign to ſerve: for their <hi>Actions and Behaviour</hi> render their <hi>Preaching</hi> not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:192035:219"/>only ineffectual, but ſcandalous to Men, and ridiculous to the inviſible adverſe Powers, who are not a little gratified with the ſpectacle of it. It puts a Slight and Contempt upon the great and noble Examples of our Saviour, and the Ancient and moſt Heroick Chriſtians; but ſpreads the Devil's Snares, and decoys Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; promotes <hi>Chriſtian Idolatry,</hi> which is Covetouſneſs, to be as effectually deſtructive as any of the <hi>Jews</hi> ever was, or any of <hi>Papiſts</hi> can be; and tempts the World to believe, that either Earthly-mindedneſs, or to mind Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, is conſiſtent with Chriſtianity, or that they are no Chriſtians, and do not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves believe what they Preach unto others.</p>
                  <p>But to ſpeak a little more diſtinctly, there are <hi>two things to be conſider'd in our Engliſh Clergy;</hi> what they have originally from Chriſt, and what they have originally from Man. From <hi>Chriſt</hi> they have Authority to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to teach and inſtruct the People, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacraments, and offer to God the ſolemn Prayers of the Church, to admoniſh, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and execute Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, where there is occaſion, and to receive the Oblations of the People for maintenance of themſelves, and for Pious Uſes; and a right to all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Submiſſion which is due to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt in ſo Holy an Imployment. And from <hi>Man,</hi> they have Houſes, and Lands,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:192035:220"/>and Revenues, and Titles, and Honours, and Civil Power and Authority, and Charges and Incumbrances. And theſe are ſome good and uſeful; and ſome evil, pernicious, inconſiſtent with their Chriſtian State; and, to be plain, Antichriſtian. The Houſes, Lands, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues may be of good uſe, if they be uſed as they ſhould be; but the reſt are Antichriſtian, under pretence of Honouring, Degrading; and under pretence of enlarging their Power with what they had not, debaſing and abridging what they had, and ſubtilly enſlaving the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt to be Servants of Men; and not the outward Man only, but their very Minds and Spirits. And here lies the very <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Iniquity.</hi> They are deprived of one part of their Chriſtian Authority, and their Hands bound, under pretence of State and Grandure, by having Chancellors, like the Grandees of the World. They are ſubjected to the State by their Acceptance of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Dignities from thence, (the very Temptation that was offer'd by the Devil to our Saviour, and a betraying of the Rights of the Church of Chriſt.) And the Papal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chroachments and Uſurpations being transferred to the Crown, and all Eccleſiaſtical Preferments coming from the King, this is firſt a <hi>Bait</hi> to allure Ambitious Minds, and then an <hi>Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> upon them, that they dare not diſpleaſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:192035:220"/>the Creator of their Grandure, though for the Service of their true Lord and Maſter, and the Saviour of their Souls. So that we are like to have a continual Succeſſion of Flatterers of Princes, inſtead of faithful Monitors, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Servants of the great God to be; and Nurſeries of falſe Loyalty, inſtead of true Piety and Devotion to God; and of Inſtruments of inceſſant Diſſentions between Prince and People, inſtead of Healers of our Breaches; a juſt Judgment or deſerved conſequence of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge and Uſurpation upon the Church of Chriſt. And here, if I be not much miſtaken, lyeth <hi>the Root of all the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappineſs of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and at this time in particular.</p>
                  <p>The Providence of God hath not at any time been wanting to us; but we have been always wanting to our Duty to Him, and to our own true Intereſt. And though all have been wanting, yet the beginning of this defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency hath been in them, who ſhould have better attended to, and wiſely conſider'd the Motions of Providence, and been the firſt active vigorous Movers to the reſt to have correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with it: But, alas! they attended more to the Motions of Men, and to pleaſe them, or at leaſt not diſpleaſe them, for their own Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Security; and this is call'd Prudence forſooth: And ſohave we loſt a moſt favourable Opportunity put into our hands.

                  <p>The <hi>Church of England</hi> hath been in <hi>Bondage,</hi> under the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> ever ſince it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the <hi>Roman</hi> Uſurpations, which were not totally aboliſhed, but too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to another Maſter; and a <hi>Slaviſh Spirit</hi> hath ever ſince poſſeſſed it. It did quietly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſs in the greateſt <hi>Sacriledge</hi> that ever was committed: It contentedly ſuffer'd the moſt ſolemn part of its <hi>Liturgy,</hi> compoſed by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops, and, as was declared by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the aid of the Holy Ghoſt, to be <hi>diſmember'd, diſorder'd, and defac'd,</hi> and the Chriſtian Sacrifice aboliſhed by Foreigners, and a Factious Party, which have ever ſince been Thorns in their Sides, without the concurrence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Clergy. The true Chriſtian <hi>Diſcipline</hi> they never had the Courage to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to reſtore, though an Office was prepar'd for a Memorial, with a Wiſh to have it reſtor'd, from the beginning, which King <hi>Charles</hi> II. obſerving upon an <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday,</hi> ask'd, <hi>Why do they not reſtore it? Who hinders 'em?</hi> And
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:192035:222"/>for the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God, we have ordinarily on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mattens and Veſpers, and that too only on the Lord's-Day, and in that too the Prayers ſhort and deficient, either to excite, or to expreſs the Devotions of the People, where there is any; and beſides all this, what we have, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly read with ſo little Devotion, as gives Scandal to many, and no little diſturbance to others. And our very <hi>Sacraments</hi> and moſt Holy Things, no leſs than Holy-Days, are ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly prophaned. <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which is the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of our engaging in the Chriſtian Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, not only permitted, but even forced upon ſuch as do not deſire it, either for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their Children; but bring their Infant Children either for fear of the Apparator, or out of Cuſtom to be like their Neighbours, without any ſenſe or underſtanding of ſo much of the Chriſtian Religion as was required anciently of Catechumens, before they were admitted to <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> And that other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>Holy Memorials of our Saviour's Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which, from the riſing of the Sun to the ſetting of it, that is, all over the World, hath, in all Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, for the ſolemn Worſhip of God, till the laſt Age, been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before God, as a ſolemn Recognition of our Redemption by Chriſt, and Subjection to him as our Lord, hath been not only moſt ſhamefully neglected, and ſo treated, both
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:192035:223"/>in Sermons from the Pulpit, and in Printed Books, that it appears few amongſt us rightly underſtand it at this day; but moſt horribly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fan'd, not only by common admittance of all that will to it, but even forcing the moſt wicked and profane Officers to it, upon the Penalty of loſing their Places. And ſo unhappily have ſome of our Controverſies with <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks</hi> been managed, and ſo ſuperficially and impertinently our Preaching been generally throughout the Nation, that we have diſputed one part, into disbelief of the Scriptures and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity; another, into contempt of one of the chief Principles of Chriſtianity; and generally all, into Neglect and Contempt of the Examples, Precepts, and Counſels of greateſt Perfection in the Chriſtian Religion; and together with that, preached the People generally into a careleſs tepid ſtate of Indifferency; ſo that in the Country eſpecially, it is rare to meet with two or three good ſenſible intelligent lively Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in a Pariſh. And who of our principal Clergy can deny any of this? And if it be all true, why is it not reformed? If they cannot reform all, why not as much as they can? Why is not the <hi>Chriſtian Worſhip</hi> reſtored in their Cathedrals? And if thoſe be ſo burden'd by prophane Officers impoſed upon them, that they fear to expoſe it, why do they not reform their own Families, and reſtore it at leaſt in their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:192035:223"/>own Chappels? What Account will this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church, as carnal Flatterers call it, give of their Neglect of Propagating the Goſpel in Foreign parts, at leaſt in our own Plantations, and ſuffering them to be ſuch Nourſeries of Scandals to the Infidels? What Account of the many things fit to be done at home, for the Service of their Maſter; and fit to be conſidered by them jointly in a Body, and promoted in Parliament; which yet are neither ſtudied, nor conſidered, nor ſo much as thought on by any of them, no more than if they did not belong to their Care, or were not of any Concern to their Maſter, though they ſit Seſſion after Seſſion in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament? But how can it be expected that they ſhould ever extend their care to things ſo remote, who take no more care of what doth concern them in their own Chappels and Families?</p>
                  <p>It is an amazing thing for one whoſe Eyes are open, to conſider theſe things. But it fairs with collective Bodies of Men, as with ſingle Perſons: they are ſubject to the like Diſeaſes: the State of this Church is plainly a Tepid, Scorbutick, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinarian, Laodicean State, quite ſick of the Prudentials; and has been ſo in a manner from the firſt Settlement of the Reformation. And to ſpeak freely, as becomes an honeſt Man, though there was great need of a Reformation, when it was begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> and long before; yet hath that great Work been ſo ill managed,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:192035:224"/>with more of the Antichriſtian than Chriſtian Spirit, that I cannot ſee, by any growth in Grace and Virtue, that the Bleſſing of God hath ever been with it; only he ſeems to have preſerved theſe Reformations rather as Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Corrections for the Obſtinacy of that Church which would not reform: and raiſed up and preſerved the ſeveral Sub-diviſions of Parties amongſt us for the very ſame cauſe and purpoſe. For <hi>the True Cauſe of all the Diviſions and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations amongst us,</hi> is no other but our Scandals, Abuſes and Corruptions; both by way of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſation, and by the ſpecial Judgment of God, to awaken us, if it be poſſible. And though the Bleſſing of God, the true Spiritual Chriſtian Bleſſing, be not upon them, becauſe he doth not favour <hi>Schiſms</hi> and <hi>Diviſions,</hi> yet is his Protection over them, as his Inſtruments in the Nature of a Judgment, and in ſome things to raiſe an Emulation in thoſe of the Church, if they would lay it to heart and underſtand it. For there is none of them all, but there is ſome thing in them, which may ſerve for Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Notice of ſomething amiſs in the Church.</p>
                  <p>This which I have now ſaid, may be of uſe not only to them of the Church, but alſo to all <hi>the ſeveral ſeparate Parties,</hi> and deſerve their very ſerious and deep Conſideration. For it is not a light matter <hi>to Make a Schiſm or Diviſion</hi> in any particular Church, or in the Catholick
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:192035:224"/>Church. It hath been looked upon, in all Ages, to be a <hi>damnable</hi> Sin: and who-ever doth well conſider the ſeveral weighty Admonitions in the Scriptures concerning it, if he have not a benumed Conſcience, will not make light of it; nor yield to plauſible pretences: there is nothing ſo bad, but the Wit of Man and ſubtile Suggeſtions of Satan can put a colour upon it; nor ſo good, but they can miſ-repreſent it and diſparage it: but it is dangerous and very imprudent to play tricks with Sacred things. Any thing elſe may be more ſafely medled with in that manner.</p>
                  <p>This does concern them all in general; and I muſt add a word or two more: There are none of the beſt of them, that I have yet talked with, that could or would deny that their Party was much ſunk in Piety and Virtue from thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it, which was in thoſe before them of the ſame Party. And this being ſo, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us all to conſider well, whether the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi> foretold be not an Apoſtacy in Practice, as well as in Principles? and, Whether, while we are gazing to ſee the Judgments of God upon it abroad, it may not be found amongſt us at home; and we feel, in a ſurprize upon the Nation at home, what we expect to ſee elſewhere, at <hi>Rome;</hi> as was upon this City in <hi>ſixty ſix.</hi> And certain I am, that there are not only <hi>Antichriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> amongſt us all, but whole <hi>Antichriſtian Sects and Parties,</hi> which, deceived by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:192035:225"/>of Satan, under the moſt ſpecious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of the moſt pure and refined Chriſtianity, do undermine and enervate the true Genuine Chriſtianity, and the Power of Godlineſs. It is one of <hi>the Devil's</hi> moſt ſubtile <hi>Policies,</hi> by abuſe of Scripture, and miſ-application of certain Truths, to impoſe upon People, and overturn them. So he began with our Saviour, and ſo he goes on with Profeſſors to and at this day. The Holy Scriptures are abuſed, the Honour of God is abuſed, the Merits of Chriſt are abuſed, the Guidance of the Spirit is abuſed, the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Condeſcention of the Goſpel is abuſed, and whatever is moſt Excellent and Admirable is abuſed by the Subtilty of the Enemy, and the ſupine Negligence, and Inconſiderateneſs and Folly of Men. And woe be to them who dare preſume to be the Inſtruments and Leaders in theſe Abuſes and Doctrines.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that our Saviour gave Inſtructions to his Apoſtles for the Settling of his Church; and that they accordingly in all places, where there were a competent number of Converts, did ordain Elders, and gave Authority to others to do the like; and ſo ſettled a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> in the Church, which hath continued all over the World to this day. And it is certain, that the State of the <hi>Jews</hi> was ſo corrupted in his time, as provoked the Judgment of God upon them, ſo that they are a Monument thereof all over
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:192035:225"/>the World to this day; and yet neither He, nor his Diſciples, did ever refuſe communion with them, till they were caſt out; and ſo far was he from allowing them to ſeparate, that he foretold their being caſt out of the Synagogues, as part of the Perſecution they were to ſuffer. It is alſo certain, that our Saviour did foretell that many falſe Prophets, <hi>that is,</hi> falſe Teachers, ſhould come in his Name, and deceive many; and gave great Caution not to go out or believe them; and that his Apoſtles did the like, and did with great earneſtneſs exhort all to beware of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Schiſms, and Separations in the Church: And accordingly, in all Ages, for Men to take upon them the Office of Elders or Miniſters of the Goſpel, without a Regular Ordination, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived by Succeſſion from the Apoſtles; or to draw away people after them, and engage them in Separate Parties, hath been looked upon as a heinous Sin; and whoever have done ſo have been Infamous in the Church ever ſince. And therefore, if our Diſſenters did continue daily with one accord at our Temples, as the primitive Chriſtians did, and did continue their Aſſemblies at their own Meeting-places, for Inſtruction and Edification, without any Separation from the Church, provided there was nothing but true Chriſtian Doctrine taught amongſt them, I do not ſee but they might be of very good Uſe, and deſerve not only an Indulgence, but Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:192035:226"/>from the Publick Authority. But they, who make a Trade of it to engage Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Parties, I do verily believe have much to anſwer for before God: and thoſe who deſire to be Chriſtians indeed, had need to beware of them. And this I muſt in juſtice ſay, after all I have ſaid concerning what is amiſs amongſt us, that, thanks be to God, we have thoſe amongſt us, who, for good Learning, for profitable Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for ſincere Piety, Devotion, and all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, are no way inferior to any of the Diſſenters, if to be equalled by any of them: and yet I cannot ſay they are ſo many, but there may be reaſon enough to receive thoſe Labourers alſo into our Lord's Harveſt. And I heartily wiſh it was well conſidered, How they may be made more ſerviceable in ſo important and needful a Work, without any thing of a Separation: and that they would conſider, Who They are, who ſit in <hi>Moſes,</hi> or rather the Apoſtles Seat, and, What our Lord doth require in that reſpect.</p>
                  <p>And now, to come more particularly to the PEOPLE of that Party call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> I muſt firſt acquaint them, that I have not only had ſeveral <hi>Conferences,</hi> with the Principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their Party, whom they call <hi>Miniſters,</hi> but have alſo ſent them ſeveral <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> to their Second Days Meetings: And as our Conferences have hitherto been managed in a very friendly manner, ſo I do deſire to proceed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:192035:226"/>in the ſame manner with them alſo: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what is directed at firſt only to the ſecond days Meeting, I ſhall deſire them now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as intended from the firſt for them all, though I thought it moſt fair and decent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in that order. And it is as followeth:</p>

                        <p>MY Hearts deſire and Prayer to God for you all, is, that ye may be ſaved: for I am perſwaded that you have a Zeal of God, at least many of you, though not according to Knowledge in ſome things. Nevertheleſs, whereto ye have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in that I deſire ye may be eſtabliſhed, and that God will be graciouſly pleaſed to reveal the rest to you, that ye may be perfect and intire, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing. For which purpoſe I come, I trust, by the Grace of God, with a Meſſage of Grace and Peace to you. I am well ſatisfied that it is no meer Humane Project or Artifice, that at first raiſed you up, and hath conducted you hitherto: but a Supernatural Power, and that it is of the Lord, ſome way or other, (as was the Separation
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:192035:227"/>of the Ten Tribes from <hi>Rehoboam, 1</hi> King. <hi>12.</hi>) for Correction and Reformation of ſomething amiſs in this Church. And therefore I dare not preſume, either upon my own head, or by my own Ability, to intermeddle in it. But my Heart is inlarged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you upon theſe Conſiderations: <hi>1.</hi> That ye do aſſert one of the Great and Chief Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, which I have obſerved to be very unworthily and even deſpitefully treated by too many, who have gotten into, or ſeek, Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Imployment in the Church, without Check or Reproof; and ſo unworthily deſerted by most, for fear of reproach, or diſgrace, or hindrance in their Preferment, that I have not known it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly aſſerted by above two or three in the Pulpit, (but thoſe great Men indeed) though it be plainly a Doctrine moſt authentickly and ſolemnly profeſſed and declared in the <hi>Church of England. 2.</hi> That ye do bear a good Teſtimony againſt other Abuſes connived at, or tolerated amongſt us. <hi>3.</hi> I am moved with Pity towards you, that you ſhould have ſo great Cauſes of Offence or Scandal given you, againſt the Holy and Eſtabliſhed Inſtitutions and Ordinances of Chriſt, for the Miniſterial Office; for the Admiſſion of Proſelytes; and for the great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the Chriſtian Worſhip, which hath been ſo long abuſed with Controverſies, that I know very few Perſons now amongſt us, who do rightly and compleatly underſtand it; and even againſt the Perſon, Satisfaction, and Merits of Chriſt himſelf.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:192035:227"/>But when I conſider your Notions and Sentiments concerning theſe things, though I am well ſatisfied that you are under the Conduct and Energy of ſome Spiritual Power; yet, <hi>What that Spirit is?</hi> and, <hi>Whether One or Divers?</hi> in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth deſerve very good Conſideration. Ye know what Spirit it was, which God ſent between <hi>Abimelech</hi> and the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> Jud. <hi>9.23.</hi> and what that was, that was ſent from the Lord to <hi>Saul, 1</hi> Sam. <hi>6.14.</hi> and what that was, that was commiſſioned by God in the caſe of <hi>Ahab, 1</hi> King. <hi>22.22, 23.</hi> and what that was, in the midſt of the Princes of <hi>Noph,</hi> Iſa. <hi>19.14.</hi> which was from the Lord too. And that ſuch a Spirit hath been among ſome call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> is manifeſt both by their Actions, Speeches, and Writings; nay, the very Spirit of the Devil, and of Antichriſt, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and undeniable, from the Indignities offered both in word and deed, to Holy things. But that is not the thing now to be conſidered, what Spirits may have appeared among them. For even among the Apoſtles, Satan had power to enter into <hi>Judas;</hi> and it is not improbable but thoſe, whom our Saviour told, <hi>Ye know not what Spirit ye are of;</hi> and even <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, when our Saviour ſaid to him, <hi>Get thee behind me, Satan,</hi> might not at the time be free from ſome Impreſſions of Evil Spirits. That, 'tis likely, was a Peculiarity of our Saviour's, for the Prince of this World to have nothing in him. But the thing to be conſidered, is, <hi>What Spirit
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:192035:228"/>that is which at firſt excited, and hath now the Conduct of the whole Body of this People?</hi> And, not, whether it be ſent, or commiſſioned from God? but, <hi>Whether</hi> it be <hi>one of the Miniſtring Spirits</hi> ſent forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation? or, <hi>One of thoſe Seducing Spirits,</hi> to whom, in the latter times, that ſome would give heed, was, in the times of the Apoſtles, expreſsly ſaid by the Spirit of God? And great <hi>Reaſon</hi> there is to take this into very deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe of the many and weighty <hi>Cautions</hi> given by our Saviour and his Apoſtles, and left upon record in the Sacred Scriptures, for our warning in theſe latter times, to beware of them, and not to go out after them; with <hi>Admonitions</hi> concerning their Subtilty, their Energy or Power, and their ſtrong Deluſions to deceive, if it were poſſible, the very Elect; and that even Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is transformed into an Angel of Light, that is, puts on the Appearance of an Angel of Light, <hi>(2 Cor. 11.14.)</hi> and, laſtly, that we ſhould try the Spirits, <hi>(1 Jo. 4.1.) 2.</hi> Becauſe, if the <hi>Tryal</hi> be by Agreement or Diſagreement with the Doctrine, Inſtitutions and Ordinances of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles authorized by him, they may ſeem to have apoſtatized and gone off, or, at leaſt, fallen ſhort of them, in matters of great Moment, and ſpecial concern, thoſe before mentioned; and therefore to be Seduced by ſome <hi>Spirit of Error:</hi> For I doubt not but the Devil himſelf hath that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:192035:228"/>Malice and Envy againſt the Man Chriſt Jeſus, by whom he hath been Conquered and Vanquiſhed, and againſt the Solemn Memorial of that Victory, that could he but keep people from engaging in that Holy Covenant with Him by Baptiſm, and from the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of that Memorial, he would be willing himſelf to lead them into all other Truth, upon that condition, rather than fail. Yet notwithſtanding, ſince they are a Sober People, have received, retained, and do act upon one of the chief Principles of Chriſtianity, and have divers commendable things in them; and what Errors they have fallen into, have been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Scandals and Offences given by thoſe of the Church, who will have a ſad account to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for it: I do hope in the Mercy and Goodneſs of God, that if it be a good Spirit, which hath the Conduct of them, he ſhall lead and diſpoſe thoſe who are Sincere amongſt them, to the acknowledgment of the Truth in thoſe things, whereto they have not yet attained; and if it be otherwiſe, he ſhall be forced to reſign the Conduct of them to a more powerful and better Guide; and that we ſhall ſee ſuch a Society of <hi>Compleat Chriſtians</hi> come out of this deſpiſed People, as are at this time hardly to be found in any part of the World, that I know of. Theſe are my Thoughts, and Hopes concerning this People in general at preſent. And Hopes, I ſay, grounded upon the Mercy of God, and Power of God, which no Good Being would oppoſe; nor no Evil Power can ſtand before. And in His Name I come
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:192035:229"/>unto you, knowing aſſuredly that neither I, nor any Humane Ability, is able to prevail againſt the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that is amongſt you, notwithſtanding the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Truths that I have mentioned already, and ſhall endeavour, by the Grace and Aſſiſtance of God Almighty, through our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, more fully to explain unto you in due time: But, as I ſaid, if it be a good Power, it will fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me and aſſiſt me in it, and rejoyce in it too: and if it be an Evil Power Commiſſioned, it muſt ceaſe, and ſubmit to that Victorious and All-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Name: Its Enchantments muſt be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and its Sophiſtry and Falacies detected. I therefore, as an Ambaſſador of Chriſt, in the Spirit and Meekneſs of Chriſt, beſeech you, Be ye reconciled to the Truths of God, and receive them with that Reverence and Gratitude that is meet, without Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, or regard to any Temporal concern. I do not invite you to return to the Abuſes and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which you have forſaken, but to thoſe Truths, and to the due uſe of thoſe Holy things, againſt which you have been Scandalized by thoſe Abuſes and Corruptions. Nor do I invite you to diſſolve your Society, or to leave off your Meetings, and drown your ſelves in a promiſcuous Multitude. No, you have in part born a good Teſtimony, and I would have you do ſo ſtill: But I invite you only to make your Teſtimony more Compleat, Illuſtrious, and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable, by bearing your Teſtimony to the whole Truth; and not any longer a Teſtimony like the Feet
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:192035:229"/>of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Image, partly ſtrong, and partly weak, by a mixture of Truth with Falſhood; for that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand long together; but to ſtrengthen the things that remain, and ſet in order the things that are wanting, that ye may ſtand; for otherwiſe ye will certainly be Broken to Pieces. I invite you but to what I am doing my ſelf with a ſmall Company of Poor people, that is bearing a Teſtimony for God, and manifeſtly under his Conduct: But it is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by them, to whom it hath been offered for a ſufficient Time, and in a ſufficient Manner, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Learning, and pretence to Knowledge: And now it is offered to you, a deſpiſed People, that God may humble the Proud and High-minded, and confound the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, by mean and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable things, in the ſight of Men. Be Wiſe, and neglect not the Opportunity, and you, who were laſt in the Worlds account, ſhall be firſt. What ever you do, you will find there is ſolid Truth in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and I wiſh you may receive it to the Honour and Glory of God, and your own Comfort and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and you will then find me to have been</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:192035:234"/>Solemn Worſhip, and under the moſt ſpecious appearance of the Spirit of God, by ſenſible Motions to things appearing Good, and by Falſe Lights, to corrupt and adulterate them, and get and keep a reſidence in them, as if it was the Spirit of Chriſt? Whether ſuch Obſtinacy, ſuch Fallacy, in ſuch a Matter, of ſuch Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Chriſtianity, and yet ſo eaſie to Man, and void of all Exceptions, be not plain Evidence of a Myſtery of Iniquity in it?</item>

Whether to deliver thoſe things in the Name of the Lord, as immediately from the Lord, and by his Spirit, which may be plainly perceived and detected to proceed either from a humane Spirit, or a Spirit of Error, be not a great Preſumption againſt the Holy Majeſty of God, and a great Scandal to the Holy Doctrine of the Guidance of the Spirit of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a double and great Sin; the Sin of the Falſe Prophets of old, and that which in <hi>Germany</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and ſince in this Nation, raiſed ſo great a Prejudice againſt the Truth?</item>

                  <p>Upon the peruſal of theſe Queſtions, it may be ſuppoſed that ſome <hi>Anſwer</hi> was returned, and therefore ſome account of that may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be expected; and I ſhould have been glad to have been able to have anſwered ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable an Expectation more fully: but the truth in ſhort is, that eight of the firſt ten were
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:192035:234"/>anſwered affirmatively, but the other two were anſwered indeed, but with Anſwers not to the Queſtions: and the other ten remain yet to be anſwered; but I hope upon due conſideration will be anſwered at laſt, not with words only, but with deliberate ſolemn Actions. Nor are my <hi>Hopes</hi> without <hi>rational Ground.</hi> For in the ſeveral <hi>Conferences</hi> I have had with them, ſeven or eight at a time, of the principal leading Men of their Party, they behaved themſelves, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſerious conſiderate Perſons; heard patiently and attentively, replyed gravely and calmly, none interrupting either me or any of their own party while ſpeaking; and our Concluſion was friendly, though not altogether agreeing in the ſame Sentiments. And this is my Ground in reſpect of the <hi>Perſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the <hi>Matter</hi> it ſelf in queſtion, That they have been led into Error and Miſtake in ſome things, the due Conſideration of theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions will in a great meaſure make them ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And when, beſides, they ſhall conſider by what Means they, who miſled the reſt, came to overſhoot themſelves, and fall into thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, <hi>viz.</hi> through the Scandals before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and that common Infirmity incident to us Mortals, to run from one Extream into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this will farther ſatisfie and confirm them in the truth of it. And if to theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be added a clear Explication of the Truth,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:192035:235"/>which they did not rightly apprehend before; this, with the Grace of God, will farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the Mind of thoſe, who are ſincere, and regard Truth more than any temporal Concern, with much Satisfaction, <hi>viz.</hi> That Baptizm with Water, and that <hi>Noble Solemnity of the Chriſtian Worſhip,</hi> are not needleſs <hi>Types and Shadows</hi> of things paſt and fulfilled, as they imagin, but So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Expreſſions and Declarations, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſively and remarkably ſignificative than Words, before God, Angels, Devils and Men, of preſent Acts of the Mind, of what is internally and inviſibly at the ſame inſtant acted in Spirit; the one, of our <hi>Engagement in an Holy Covenant with God in Chriſt,</hi> by putting off, by Repentance, our Pollutions through Sin, and Dedication of our Selves to the Holy Trinity; the other, of our <hi>Recognition</hi> of our Redemption by Chriſt, by his Death and Sacrifice upon the Croſs, and of his Dominion over us, and our Subjection to Him, even to lay down our Lives in Obedience to Him, as he did His in Obedience to his Father; which is done by making our Solemn Addreſs, and preſenting our Prayers to the Father, with the Memorials of his Paſſion, as the Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for the Sins of Mankind, and Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of thoſe Memorials, being Conſecrated not only by a Separation to a Holy Uſe, but by a real Sanctification through the Spirit of God at the Prayers of the Church, whereby the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:192035:235"/>Faithful have a real and Spiritual Communion with Him, and one with another. This is the pure Offering of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> foretold by <hi>Malachy,</hi> That it ſhould be Offer'd by them from the riſing of the Sun, even unto the going down of the ſame. And this is the Senſe and Meaning thereof received and retained by the Church of Chriſt all over the World, till <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s new Notions became received as the Pure Word of God, and made this moſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, moſt Holy, and moſt Auguſt Sacrament, as it is deſervedly call'd by Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> be taken in effect for a needleſs Ceremony, or of no great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, by others beſides the Quakers, and uſed, or rather neglected, accordingly even to this day. Theſe are the great things in it, which I have now mentioned, but rare to be found in our Books now a days, or heard of from our Pulpits: Nor can it conveniently here be explained as it deſerves. But as to both theſe, what is ſaid before, <hi>pag.</hi> 13, 14. ought to be conſider'd. Theſe things, I ſay, well conſider'd, cannot chooſe but make great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the Minds of thoſe who are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and have a due ſenſe of their own Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Eternal concerns.</p>
                  <p>But when they ſhall alſo underſtand, That the great Principle of the <hi>Guidance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of God, is not ſo peculiar to themſelves as they imagin, but the conſtant Doctrine of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:192035:236"/>
                     <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> in all Ages, and of the <hi>Church of England</hi> in particular, (as I have ſhew'd in a Diſcourſe of <hi>Myſtical Divinity,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers under the Title of <hi>Aſceticks, or the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Piety and Vertue of the Ancients,</hi>) and notwithſtanding the Extravagancies of ſome inconſiderate Oppoſers of Fanaticiſm, aſſerted by moſt eminent Men of this <hi>Church,</hi> as the profound Dr. <hi>Cradock,</hi> lately deceaſed, (who himſelf told me, he had Preached twenty or thirty Sermons upon that Subject) and others now living; and that there are and have been, before <hi>George Fox</hi> appeared in the World, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Communion of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as well acquainted with Spiritual things as themſelves; and, by conſequence, how little neceſſity there is of venturing upon the Sin of Schiſm for that cauſe: And moreover conſider, that Chriſt appointed an <hi>Order of Men</hi> for his Miniſterial Office <hi>to ſucceed in his Church</hi> by an external Call and Commiſſion; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Corruptions of thoſe who ſate then in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Seat, would not ſuffer his Diſciples to break Communion with them, or diſregard their Authority; and by conſequence how dangerous it may prove in the end, for Men to preſume to ſet up Parties, and draw People after them contrary to his Orders, and to continue ſo to do, after fair Warnings and unanſwerable Admonitions to the contrary.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:192035:236"/>
                  <p> To conclude, When they ſhall farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how horrid a Sin it muſt needs be to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to attribute to the Holy Spirit of God, the Workings of their own Imaginations, or perhaps the Subtile Suggeſtions of ſome wicked Spirit of Deluſion; and to expoſe and ſcandalize the Holy Doctrine of the Guidance of the Holy Spirit, by denying of certain and manifeſt Truths; and uſing ſuch little Shifts and Evaſions to oppoſe plain Evidence, as an honeſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Lawyer would ſcorn and be aſhamed to uſe for his Client: When all theſe things, and more that might be obſerved, are well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and conſidered, why may I not with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hope that all, who are really ſuch as they have appeared, in the ſeveral Conferences I have had with them, to be, ſhould anſwer the End of my Letters and Queſtions, with more than civil and kind Words, in real and ſolemn Actions? Why ſhould I not hope that no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt, nor any Temporal Concern, ſhould hinder them? Why ſhould I not hope, that ſince God hath apparently again concluded all under Sin, (which all Parties confeſs of all others but their own, and is true of all without exception) that all ſhould humble themſelves before Him, return to mutual Charity one with another, and ſubject themſelves, and all their Imaginations, to his Wiſdom, as well as their Actions to his Will, to the intent that he may
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:192035:237"/>have Mercy upon all? Why ſhould I not hope, I ſay, ſince God hath done this, and for this End, that they, if they be indeed partakers of his Holy Spirit, ſhould be the firſt in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory to God, by ſuch a juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Humiliation before his Divine Majeſty, and Acknowledgment of our Humane Infirmity, if never ſo little left to our ſelves, or but ſteping aſide out of the Order of his Holy Conduct; and ſubject themſelves intirely and readily to all the Orders he hath appointed in his Church? No ſober wiſe Man will expoſe himſelf, and lead others into Danger or Hazard, when he may without any Difficulty or Incumbrance put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and them into Safety and Security: Nor will any ingenious Man, if he have committed a Miſtake, ſtand it out and maintain it againſt a Grave and Judicious Man: Much leſs will any conſiderate Man, who hath any ſenſe of God, and regard to his tremendous Majeſty, dare to perſiſt in Oppoſing or Diſputing his <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> or <hi>Orders:</hi> and therefore I ſhall here conclude this.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe I have received <hi>certain Queſtions</hi> concerning theſe Matters, but without any Name of any who ſent them, or to whom I ſhould return <hi>Anſwer,</hi> though I ſhall forbear to expoſe them, by making them publick; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am debtor both to the wiſe and to the unwiſe, for their Satisfaction, who are either
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:192035:237"/>moved with ſuch Scruples, or rely upon ſuch infirm Grounds, I ſhall return a brief compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Anſwer to the Eight Queſtions in theſe following Aſſertions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament is the only <hi>Rule of Faith and Practice,</hi> rightly underſtood and uſed: But it is in many Caſes only a General Rule, leaving the ſpecial Application in ſome, to all Perſons; in others, to certain determinate Perſons. And therefore to require Expreſs and Plain Scripture for Faith and Practice in all things, doth proceed from Ignorance and Weakneſs in ſome, but too often from a diſingenuous Spirit of Contention, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt Deſign, or Satanical Deluſion.</p>
                  <p>The Practices of the Primitive Chriſtians were ſome Permanent, to continue in the Church; others Temporary, and Alterable, according as there might be occaſion, for Order, Decency, and Edification, and did vary from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſeveral Churches and parts of the World; whereas the others were truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, according to <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis</hi> his Rule, <hi>that is,</hi> univerſally obſerved without any known beginning ſince the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spirit of God</hi> was <hi>poured forth upon all Fleſh,</hi> when the Goſpel was Preached to all Fleſh, or to every Creature, <hi>that is,</hi> not only to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo. But as to individual Perſons, it was never ſo poured out
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:192035:238"/>upon all Fleſh, but there were ſome things pre-acquired; as <hi>Faith in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>ordinarily Baptiſm with Water, Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. Nor was <hi>the Manifeſtation thereof</hi> ever given to every one; but to every one to whom it was given, it was given to profit withall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God:</hi> and, <hi>If any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.14, &amp; 9. But it is to be known and remembred, that a great and principal, and the moſt certain Leading of the Spirit of God is not ſenſible, or eaſily perceivable how it comes; but it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a Secret Illumination of the Mind to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Excellence of the things of God, and the Emptineſs and Deceitfulneſs of the things of the World; from which proceeds an Appetite to thoſe, and an Indifference to theſe; and in particular actions a like ſecret Illumination of the Mind, to apply the general Rules of the Scriptures to the particular Senſe, and an Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Will to what is ſo perceived to be the Will of God. And in more ſenſible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Impreſſions, and Openings, as ſome call them, the <hi>Tryal</hi> is by their Agreement with what is agreed to proceed from the Spirit of God; <hi>that is,</hi> the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that is to be rejected, as coming from the Enemy: what is not inconſiſtent with that ought to be followed; or if doubtful, be referred
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:192035:238"/>to the Judgment and Determination of the Elders, according to the Obſervations of the Ancients; or of the moſt Experienced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, eſpecially of ſuch as by their Office and Place are authorized, and obliged to be <hi>Guide of Souls.</hi> And thoſe who have preſumed to reject theſe Ordinary Means, which God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and eſtabliſhed in his Church, have frequently fallen into Miſchief.</p>
                  <p>There are many of the Mind of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Act. 8.18. they are deſirous to purchaſe it, but not at the Price our Saviour ſet it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.44, 46. And there are many falſe counterfeit Spirits, very officious to offer themſelves where they find hopes of Reception; and they always ſuggeſt and inſtigate to the following of their Leading, which is inſenſibly, and as they find their Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers diſpoſed, from the Holy Scriptures, and from Chriſt; and when they cannot prevail with them in that manner, they endeavour to fill them with Spiritual Pride and Conceitedneſs, make them admired by others, as extraordinary and very Holy Perſons, that they may make them think better of themſelves than they ought, and ſo get advantage of them that way. And there are generally two great Faults committed by moſt Pretenders to the Guidance of the Spirit. 1. They do not well conſider themſelves, and teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the neceſſary Qualifications pre-acquired for the obtaining of ſo great a Divine Favour.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:192035:239"/>2. They neither conſider nor teach others the neceſſary Cautions and Directions for Tryal of Spirits. In general the Conſcientious Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Scriptures, is a principal thing for both. For as the Law was our School-Maſter to bring us to Chriſt, ſo the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Obſervation of the externally revealed Will of God, which is Obedience, is our School-Maſter to prepare us for, and bring us to the true Spirit of God. But for more particular <hi>Cautions</hi> and <hi>Directions,</hi> that is a Subject too large for this Occaſion, and hath been largely treated of by others.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queſtions</hi> concerning <hi>Baptiſm with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and <hi>the Eucharist or Holy Communion,</hi> are e'en ſuch as that of <hi>Naaman,</hi> 2 Kin. 5.11, 22. But they who make them are not like the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of that Heathen, who gave him this pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Admonition: <hi>If the Prophet had bid thee do ſome great thing, wouldſt thou not have done it? How much rather when he ſaith unto thee, Waſh and be clean?</hi> May they at leaſt take Example from that Heathen, who received the Admonition even from his Servants, even with the like bleſſed Succeſs. And this, with what I have ſaid before, is as much as I apprehend neceſſary to be ſaid to the <hi>Queſtions,</hi> for ſuch ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Perſons, as are willing to be ſatisfied and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Truth: and I ſhall be ready to give them all further Satisfaction, when I underſtand where any real Scruple doth remain.</p>

                  <p>WHAT I have written, I have written with all Plainneſs and Simplicity, with all Candor and Impartiality, and Good Will to all; without any other Deſign than for the Service of God, and the Good of all; and without any Affectation of any Ornament, as becomes the Majeſty of the Truths of God: Yet can I not expect but I muſt incurr the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of moſt in one thing or other, when I conſider the general Corruption of Mens Minds and Judgments, as well as of their Manners, at this time; not only of the Scandalous and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, or Hypocritical Profeſſors; but even of ſuch as are ſincere in many things, and deſervedly eſteemed in the World both for Parts and Honeſty; and yet in others, not ſo compleat as might be wiſhed, partly through the <hi>Byaſs of their own Diſpoſitions,</hi> and partly through the <hi>Common Cheat of Honourable Names;</hi> ſuch as <hi>Prudence, Moderation, Diſcretion, Charity,</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:192035:240"/>&amp;c. and their Contraries, calling Good, Evil; and Evil, Good; and partly through certain <hi>Falſe Notions,</hi> undermining the Integrity of the Evangelical Doctrine of Chriſt, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and rendring it of none Effect in many things; which have been <hi>introduced and recommended</hi> to the World, by <hi>a late Sect</hi> appearing in a very plauſible Form, but, in truth, generated by an unnatural Copulation of <hi>Church of England</hi> with ſome <hi>Socinian Principles,</hi> ſetting up their own <hi>Corrupt Humane Reaſon</hi> in the place of the <hi>Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and wreſting the divinely inſpired <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> to a Compliance with it; perſwading themſelves and others that the Noble Heroick Virtues, ſo much ſtudied and practiſed by the ancient Chriſtians, ſuch as <hi>Humility, Contempt of the World, Heavenly-mindedneſs,</hi> &amp;c. were for times of Perſecution; but we are under another Diſpenſation; as I my ſelf have been told by a Principal Author and Promoter of it; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging ſuch <hi>Temporizing Compliances,</hi> under the ſpecious Pretences of <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> as are not only Inlets to Sin, and Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances of Graces, but inconſiſtent with the Practices and Sentiments of the beſt Chriſtians of all Ages, with the Doctrines and Inſtructions of the Apoſtles, the Example and Precepts of our Saviour himſelf, (to ſay nothing of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Counſels in this Age) our Baptiſmal
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:192035:240"/>Engagements, and the Genuine Spirit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and the Intereſt of the Kingdom of Chriſt in this World. What Gloſſes they make upon our Saviour's Sermon upon the Mount, I muſt leave to others better acquainted with them, to conſider. But, What can be expected from perſons ſo levened, but as ſevere Cenſures of this Writing as they take this to be of others? but that reaſonable Expreſſions of juſt Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Abuſes and Corruptions in Matters of Religion, or at abuſe of Scriptures to patronize Vanity, and by perſons profeſſing Religion, ſhould be cenſured for <hi>Paſſion?</hi> but that ſuch warm Expreſſions and Charges, as were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to awaken ſuch out of a Deadly Slumber, as Experience had proved, could not be moved by gentler touches, ſhould be cenſured as <hi>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:192035:241"/>Importance; whoſe Prudence prefers to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance Religion with Perukes, and Laces, and Topknots, and Servants in Livery, rather than to bear the Reproach of Chriſt, in bearing Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt the Vanities of the Age, by the tacit Reproof of them in a decent but plain and a little unfaſhionable Attire; who preferr Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity at home, in providing for the temporal concerns of themſelves and their Families, with ſome little creditable Acts of Charity, as we call it, before truſting to Providence in more liberal Contributions to unfaſhionable Good Works: to leave ſuch, I ſay, and to come cloſe to the buſineſs, to <hi>the State of the Church,</hi> (of which I am yet a Member, and am not ſatisfied to ſeparate while I live in the Nation, notwithſtanding all I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in it) for this is the Root of all, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be conſidered; and they are to take care of the Diſſenters: If we conſider the Great things belonging to the <hi>Charge</hi> of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of this Church, both <hi>ſeverally</hi> in their particular Dioceſſes, the State of the Clergy and People there; and <hi>joyntly</hi> to them all as one Body, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Court,</hi> and the <hi>Nobility;</hi> The <hi>

To theſe I will add but one or two <hi>Particulars,</hi> of Occurrences in this Reign: One, of <hi>a Bill for Suppreſſion of Vice and Debauchery,</hi> drawn indeed at their Requeſt; but after it had been peruſed and perfected, not only by able Counſel, but by all the Judges then in Town, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>a Needful and Hopeful Reformation,</hi> begun by the Authority and Encouragement of the QUEEN, and not only vigorouſly proſecuted here in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> but in a hopeful way in many other Cities and Counties all over the Nation, and this ſtopped firſt by a Combination of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex</hi> Juſtices, (I need ſay no more) but at laſt more effectually in a Judicature of Equity, in the Preſence of no leſs than ſeven of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Prelates, by two wicked Men, the one Speaker, and the other a Member of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Ralph Hartley,</hi> who is ſtill a Sufferer between a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of City Magiſtrates, and a Combination of <hi>Surry</hi> Juſtices, and ſome other perſons, and ſhamefully oppreſſed by them.</note> Juſtice of the Peace, who had been moſt diligent, and other perſons concerned in the Promotion of that Good Work, checked, vilified, and abuſed, without any juſt cauſe, to the diſcouragement of the Execution of the Laws, and Contempt of Her Majeſty's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and all in the Preſence of thoſe Biſhops, who came on purpoſe to countenance the Cauſe of Reformation, were ſatisfied of the Iniquity
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:192035:242"/>of the Proceedings againſt it, and yet not one of them ever appeared after in it, to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe more than in one little printed Diſcourſe in Vindication of the Gentleman ſo abuſed, as aforeſaid. And what Account can be given of theſe things?</p>
                  <p>It is a great Truth, <hi>That neither King, nor Parliament, nor Biſhops,</hi> of themſelves and their own Motion, <hi>have done any one Act,</hi> that I know of, <hi>worthy of the Name of Chriſtian.</hi> And where lyeth the Fault of all this, but at their door, who, inſtead of Admoniſhing, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing, and Animating to due Returns of true Gratitude in Fact to God, for his admirable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, have, by their Neglect, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it, provoked the Favours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to withdraw, and to leave us to our ſelves, and to eat the Fruit of our own doings? And whence comes this Neglect of ſo many ſo obliged, but from a common Defect of Good Education at the Univerſities, and the Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Preferments?</p>
                  <p>But is not this Great Uncharitableneſs, may our Grave Prudential Gentlemen ſay, thus to lay open to the World the Nakedneſs of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and of the Church? Doubtleſs as great as for a Phyſician to preſcribe a bitter Potion to a tender Patient; or a Chirurgeon to cut or burn, after tryal of more gentle means, what is found otherwiſe incurable. It is that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:192035:243"/>they, at whoſe door lyeth the Root of all our Evil, may give Glory to God, by taking Shame to themſelves, and giving Good Example of <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> to others. But if they will not, I hope the deſpiſed <hi>Quakers</hi> will be ſo wiſe, as to accept the Honour of beginning the Example. For <hi>all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the Glory of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, Who call'd <hi>You</hi> to this Office? may our Prudentialiſts ſay: <hi>By what Authority doſt</hi> Thou <hi>this?</hi> and, <hi>Who gave</hi> Thee <hi>this Authority?</hi> He who gave me Eyes to ſee, and a Heart to be ſenſible of it, and a Mind to be Faithful to Him, who call'd me and led me, by his Hand, to his Holy Service, not for filthy Lucre's ſake; not to make a Trade of it; not to ſeek the World in the Church; but to ſerve Him in the Service of all Men, in the beſt manner I can.</p>
